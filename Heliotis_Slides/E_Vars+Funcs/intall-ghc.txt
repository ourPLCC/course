Welcome to Haskell!

This will download and install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) for 
the Haskell programming language, and the Cabal build tool.

It will add the 'cabal', 'ghc', and 'ghcup' executables to bin directory 
located at: 

  /Users/jeh/.ghcup/bin

and create the environment file /Users/jeh/.ghcup/env
which you should source in your ~/.bashrc or similar to get the required
PATH components.

To proceed with the ghcup installation press ENTER, to cancel press ctrl-c.
Note that this script can be re-run at any given time.
