{\bf Language V6}\exx
So far, our source language has no capability to define top-level
variables that persist from one expression evaluation to another.
A {\em top-level} variable is one that has a binding
in the initial (``top-level'') environment.
We would like to extend our languages to allow for such definitions.
All we need to do is to add bindings
to the {\em initial environment}, the environment that all expressions
in the source language extend.\exx
The initial environment for our languages
is the \verb'static Env env' variable in the \verb'Program' class,
obtained by calling the \verb'initEnv()' static method
in the \verb'Env' class.
Notice that this initial (top-level) environment starts out having
an empty list of bindings.\exx
Our strategy for making top-level definitions is
to take advantage of the \verb'add' method in the \verb'Env' class.
To add a new top-level definition,
we create a \verb'Binding' object and add it
to the top-level \verb'Env' object.
Once we add bindings in this way, these bindings will be known
in any subsequent expression evaluation that uses the initial environment.
