{\bf Language V1} (continued)\exx
Since we are using the \verb'apply' method with a \verb'Prim' object,
we need to add a declaration for this method
to the (abstract) \verb'Prim' class.
Here is how we do this:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Prim
%%%
    // apply the primitive to the passed values
    public abstract Val apply(Val [] va);
%%%
\end{qv}
}
We use the parameter name `\verb'va''
to suggest the idea of a {\bf v}alue {\bf a}rray.\exx
A \verb'Prim' object (there are seven instances of this class)
has no instance variables.
However, we can endow these objects with behavior,
so that an \verb'AddPrim' object knows how to add things,
a \verb'SubPrim' object knows how to subtract things,
and so forth.\exx
