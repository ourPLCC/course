{\bf Language V4} (continued)\exx
Here are some examples of Language V4 programs using procedures:
\large
\begin{qv}
let
  f = proc(x,y) +(x,y)
in
  .f(3,8)
  % => 11

let
  f = proc(z,y) +(10,y)
in
  .f(3,8)
  % => 18

let x = 10
in
  let
    x = 7
    f = proc(y) +(x,y)
  in
    .f(8)
  % => 18
\end{qv}
\LARGE
In the third example, the \verb'x' in the \verb'proc' definition
refers to the enclosing \verb'x' (which is bound to \verb'10'),
not to the inner \verb'x' (which is bound to \verb'7').
Remember the rules for evaluating the \verb'letDecls'!
