Finally consider the following example,
which evaluates to \verb'120':
{\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  fact = proc(f,x)
    if x
    then *(x,.f(f,sub1(x)))
    else 1
in
  .fact(fact, 5)
\end{qv}
}
This example,
quite a bit more subtle than the previous ones,
shows how you can achieve recursion --
factorial, in this case --
using our simple language (which does not yet support direct recursion!).\exx
One final observation: \verb'add1' is a {\em primitive}, not a {\em procedure}.
Primitives are not expressions, and they do not evaluate to anything,
so you can't pass a primitive as an actual parameter to a procedure.
In particular, the following will not work:
{
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  app = proc(f,x) .f(x)
in
  .app(add1,3)
\end{qv}
}
Be aware that the syntax for {\em applying} a primitive looks somewhat
like applying a procedure,
except that applying a primitive does {\em not} use a DOT.
