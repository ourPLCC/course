{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
The code section defines the language semantics.
In this section, the Java classes defined by the grammar rules
are given life by defining their behavior --
specifically, by defining the \verb'$run()' method
in the start symbol class
(\verb'Program', in the case of language \verb'V0').\exx
In the absence of a redefined \verb'$run()' method --
for example, if the code section is omitted -- 
the default \verb'$run()' behavior in the \verb'_Start' class
is to print the name of the start symbol
in a format illustrated in Slide 1.29.\exx
In later versions of this language (\verb'V1' and beyond), 
we see how such a \verb'$run()' method can be used
to print the arithmetic value of an expression.
But in Language \verb'V0' we will be content
with simply printing a copy of the expression itself.\exx
{\em In the code section of a PLCC language specification,
the behavior of the \verb'$run()' method 
in the start symbol class
defines the language semantics.}
