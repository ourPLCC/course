{\bf Language OBJ} (continued)\exx
The \verb'makeObject' method is defined
for both a \verb'StdClass' and an \verb'EnvClass'.
(For all other \verb'Val' objects,
\verb'makeObject' throws an exception.)\exx
In \verb'StdClass',
\verb'makeObject' first creates an instance of the superclass,
and then stitches together an environment
that includes the static bindings,
the fields, and the methods.
Three fields are created and initialized automatically:
\verb'self' is bound to the base object (a deep binding),
\verb'super' is bound to the instance of the superclass,
and \verb'this' is bound to this object (a shallow binding).
The remaining named fields are bound to nil,
and the methods are bound to closures as in \verb'letrec'.
The code for \verb'makeObject' is given on the next two slides.
