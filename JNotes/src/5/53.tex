{\bf Language PROP} (continued)\exx
Here are the grammar rules for defining properties in a class defintion:\exx
{\Large
\emm\begin{tabular}{ll}
\verb'<props>' & \verb'**= PROPERTY <VAR> EQUALS <prop>'\\
    & \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'Props(List<Token> varList, List<Prop> propList)'}\\
\verb'<prop>' & \verb'::= PROP <exp>getExp COLON <exp>setExp'\\
    & \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'Prop(Exp getExp, Exp setExp)'}\\
\end{tabular}\exx
}
When a variable bound to a property is evaluated,
its \verb'getExp' code is executed
using the environment captured where the property is defined,
and the expressed value of the variable is the result
of evaluating the \verb'getExp' expression.\exx
When a variable bound to a property is assigned to
in a \verb'set' expression,
the RHS of the expression is evaluated in the current environment.
The environment where the property is defined
is then extended by binding
the special symbol `\verb'$'' to the value of the RHS.
The property's \verb'setExp' expression is then evaluated
in this extended environment,
and the resulting value is the value of the \verb'setExp' expression.\exx
