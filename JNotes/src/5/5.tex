{\bf Language OBJ} (continued)\exx
Every \verb'Exp' expression evaluates to a \verb'Val' object,
and a \verb'ClassExp' is no exception,
so evaluating such a \verb'ClassExp'
({\em i.e.}, calling its \verb'eval' method)
returns a \verb'Val' object.
Looking only at the syntax,
it seems reasonable
that such an object has a (possibly empty) superclass
(the \verb'ext' [for \verb'EXTENDS'] part),
a list of static identifiers bound to values,
a list of field names,
and a list of method names bound to procedures.\exx
We define a \verb'StdClass' object in the file \verb'class',
which extends the \verb'Val' class.
(Actually, it extends \verb'ClassVal' class
which in turn extends the \verb'Val' class.)
Evaluating a \verb'ClassExp' expression
returns an instance of \verb'StdClass'.\exx
[{\bf Warning}:  In this chapter we implement
classes and objects in our source language (\verb'OBJ'),
using classes and objects in our implementation language (Java).
This can be confusing.
For example, a \verb'ClassExp' evaluates to an object in Java
that represents a class in our source language.
Be sure that you have a clear understanding of the context
in which the terms ``class'' and ``object'' are being used
in the following discussion.]
