{\bf PLCC -- Tokens}\exx
If there are characters remaining in the input stream,
the \verb'cur()' method checks
the token and skip regular expressions one-by-one,
in the order in which they appear
in the lexical specification.
Each regular expression is matched
against the current unmatched input,
up to (and including) the end of the current line.
If no characters match the regular expression,
the next specification is tried.\exx
If the regular expression is a skip specification
that matches at least one input character
and if no prior token specification has found a matching token candidate,
the matched part is skipped and processing continues
on the remainder of the input,
{\em starting over from the first lexical specification}.
If a prior token specification has found a matching token candidate,
the skip specification is ignored.\exx
If a token specification match of length at least one occurs,
and if this match is longer than the match length
of the previous token candidate (if any),
this token specification is chosen
as the current token candidate.
If not, the previous token candidate is retained.\exx
