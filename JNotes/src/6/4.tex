{\bf Language INFIX} (continued)\exx
Here is a set of grammar rules
for arithmetic expressions that does the trick.
The \verb'INFIX' language is based on the SET language,
with call-by-value semantics and variable assignment.
We start with grammar rules for expressions involving
the primitive arithmetic operations
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
We will discuss additional \verb'INFIX' grammar rules later.
(A full grammar and skeleton semantics appear
in the \verb'INFIX' directory.)
In this simplified version of \verb'INFIX' grammar rules
for an expression \verb'<exp>',
we show the \verb'<factor>' nonterminal
as representing a numeric literal.
Later we will introduce ways in which
the \verb'<factor>' nonterminal represents
variables, \verb'if' expressions,
procedure definitions, and such.

\begin{qv}
<exp>                ::= <term> <terms>
<terms>              **= <prim0> <term>
<term>               ::= <factor> <factors>
<factors>            **= <prim1> <factor>
<factor>:LitFactor   ::= LIT
<prim0>:AddPrim      ::= ADDOP
<prim0>:SubPrim      ::= SUBOP
<prim1>:MulPrim      ::= MULOP
<prim1>:DivPrim      ::= DIVOP
