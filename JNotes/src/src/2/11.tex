{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
Both the \verb'EnvNode' and \verb'EnvNull' classes
define an \verb'add' method --
declared as an abstract method in the \verb'Env' class --
that takes a \verb'Binding' object as a parameter.
In the \verb'EnvNode' class, 
this method adds the binding to its local environment.
In the \verb'EnvNull' class,
this method throws an exception
(because there is no local environment to add to).\exx
Attempting to \verb'add' a binding to an \verb'Env' object
should be considered an error
if the binding's symbol already appears in the local bindings,
although this error is not checked in the \verb'Env' classes.
