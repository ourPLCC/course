{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
We will encounter language definitions
that end up creating dozens of Java source files.
To manage these complex languages,
we separate the contents of the semantics section of the grammar file
into separate files grouped by purpose.
In many cases, different languages may share some of the same source files.
The semantics section then simply identifies the names of these files
using an \verb'#include' feature
that treats the contents of these files
as if they were part of the entire grammar file.\exx
For example, one of our early languages \verb'V1'
has the following grammar file structure:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
# lexical specification
...
%
# BNF grammar
...
%
#include code            # BNF grammar semantics
#include prim            # primitive operations (PLUS, MINUS, etc.)
#include ../Env/envRN    # environment code (Env, Binding, etc.)
#include val             # value semantics (IntVal, etc.)
\end{qv}
}
