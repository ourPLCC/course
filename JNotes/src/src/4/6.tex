{\bf Types} (continued)\exx
{\bf Every expression has a type.
The type of a variable (\verb'VarExp')
is the type that is bound to the variable
in the current type environment.}
All variables must have a type binding.\exx
A {\em type error} is one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -0.5ex
\item an attempt to define a procedure whose declared return type
      does not match the type of the body of the procedure;
\item an attempt to apply a non-procedure as a procedure;
\item an attempt to apply a procedure to the wrong number
      of actual parameters;
\item an attempt to apply a procedure to actual parameters whose types
      do not match the declared types
      of the corresponding formal parameters;
\item an attempt to use a non-boolean as the test in an \verb'if' expression;
\item an attempt to have expressions of different types
      in the \verb'then' and \verb'else' parts of an \verb'if' expression;
\item an attempt to assign a value
      to a LHS variable in a \verb'set' expression
      where the type of the variable does not match the type
      of the RHS expression.
\end{itemize}
In the above, we consider primitive procedures
such as \verb'+', \verb'add1', and \verb'zero?' as procedures
for the purposes of type checking.
These primitive procedures have pre-defined procedure types.
