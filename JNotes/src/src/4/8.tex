{\bf Types} (continued)\exx
Notice that static scope rules make it possible to determine
the types of variables that appear free in a procedure body --
in other words, variables that do not appear
as procedure formal parameters.\exx
Numeric literals all have type \verb'int'.
We predefine the identifiers \verb'true' and \verb'false'
to have type \verb'bool',
with the obvious semantics
in test expressions of \verb'if...' expressions.\exx
The type of a \verb'let' or \verb'letrec' expression
is the type of the expression's body.\exx
Observe that the expressed value
of the \verb'testExp' in an \verb'IfExp'
can no longer be an \verb'IntVal',
so an expression like
{\Large
\begin{qv}
if 0 then 3 else 4
\end{qv}
}
that we have seen in Language SET
won't work in our typed language.\exx
Since the type of a variable is determined by static scope rules,
the only ``interesting'' types are those of procedures.
We need to add syntax rules for procedure definitions
that permit us to declare
the types of its formal parameters and its return type.
