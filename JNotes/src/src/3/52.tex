{\bf Language V4}\exx
So far our languages do not allow for anything like repetition.
In an expression-based language (ours fall into this category),
repetition is typically accomplished by recursion,
and recursion depends on the ability to apply procedures recursively.
So we need to build the capability to define procedures.\exx
In Language V4, we add procedure definitions
and procedure application.
The term {\em procedure} is synonomous with {\em function}.\exx
Think of a procedure as a ``black box''
that, when given zero or more input values,
returns a single result value.
The number of inputs that a procedure accepts is called its {\em arity}.\exx
To {\em define} a procedure means
to describe how it behaves.
To {\em apply} a procedure means
to give the procedure the proper number of inputs
and to receive its result.\exx
Using mathematical notation, we can {\em define} a function $f$ by
{\Large\[f(x) = x+3\]}
and we can {\em apply} the function $f$ by
{\Large\[f(5)\]}
The result of this particular application is $8$.
