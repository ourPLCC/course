{\bf Language V1} (continued)\exx
Finally we consider \verb'PrimappExp'.
A \verb'PrimappExp' object has two instance variables:
a \verb'Prim' object named \verb'prim'
and a \verb'Rands' object named \verb'rands'.
To evaluate such an expression,
we need to apply the given primitive operation
(the \verb'prim' object)
to the values of the expressions in the \verb'rands' object.\exx
An object of type \verb'Rands' has
a \verb'List<Exp>' instance variable named \verb'expList'.
In order to perform the operation determined by the \verb'prim' object,
we need to evaluate each of the expressions in \verb'expList'.
A utility method named \verb'evalRands' in the \verb'Rands' class
does the work for us.
Of course, this method needs to know what environment is being used
to evaluate the expressions,
so an \verb'Env' object is a parameter to this method.

    public List<Val> evalRands(Env env) {
        List<Val> args = new ArrayList<Val>(expList.size());
        for (Exp exp : expList)
            args.add(exp.eval(env));
        return args;
    }
