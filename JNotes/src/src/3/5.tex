{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
Observe that this PLCC language specification has all three
of the parts described in Slide Set 1a:
the lexical specification section (token specifications), 
the syntax specification section (given as BNF rules),
and the semantic specification section (just an \verb'#include' line).\exx
You can consider a grammar rule like
{\Large
\begin{qv}
<program>        ::= <exp>
\end{qv}
}
to mean that ``a \verb'program' consists of an \verb'exp'''
(where \verb'exp' stands for an ``expression'').
Similarly, you can consider a grammar rule like
{\Large
\begin{qv}
<exp>:LitExp     ::= <LIT>
\end{qv}
}
to mean that ``a \verb'LitExp' is (an instance of) an expression (an \verb'exp')
that consists of a \verb'LIT'.''
Similar remarks apply to all the grammar rules.\exx
The `\verb'#include code'' line at the end of this file
means that the contents of the file named \verb'code'
should be inserted into the \verb'grammar' file input stream
at that point to be processed by PLCC.
