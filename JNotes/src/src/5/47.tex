In method application, \verb'self' always refers to the base object,
even if \verb'self' appears in the definition of a superclass method.
This is what makes dynamic dispatch work!
\Large
\begin{qv}
define c1 =
  class
    method m1 = proc() 1
    method m2 = proc() <self>m1()
  end
define c2 =
  class extends c1
    method m1 = proc() 2
  end
define o1 = new c1
define o2 = new c2

.<o1>m1() % => 1
.<o2>m1() % => 2
.<o2>m2() % => 2!  
\end{qv}

The following slide gives another example of dynamic dispatch.
