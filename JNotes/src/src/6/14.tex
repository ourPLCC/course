{\bf Language ARRAY}\exx
The \verb'ARRAY' language extends the \verb'OBJ' language
by adding support for arrays.
This language also defines the \verb'while' primitive.
An array of a given size is created using the \verb'array' operator
followed by the size of the array in square brackets.
Here's an example:
\begin{qv}
define a = array[10]
\end{qv}
When an array is created, its elements are initialized to \verb'nil'.
Array elements are references (in the sense of a \verb'ValRef')
so they can appear on the LHS of \verb'set' expressions,
and they can refer to any \verb'OBJ' value, including other arrays.
In this way, a two-dimensional array can be constructed
as an array of (one-dimensional) arrays.\exx
Array indices are integers that range from zero to the array size minus one.
For an array \verb'a' and index \verb'i',
the expression \verb'\a[i]' refers to the value
in the array at the given index.
If \verb'\a[i]' itself refers to an array,
the value at its index position \verb'j' is \verb'\\a[i][j]'.\exx
