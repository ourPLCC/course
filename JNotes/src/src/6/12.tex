{\bf Language INFIX} (continued)\exx
Consider the expression
{\Large
\begin{qv}
x=y+5+x
\end{qv}
}
Since \verb'INFIX' is still expression-based --
every expression has a value --
the above expression must have a value,
just as we have required in languages like \verb'SET'.
But the expression also has an assignment operation
with a side-effect that modifies the value of \verb'x'.
Since the RHS of an assignment must be an \verb'<atom>',
this means that the above expression evaluates like this:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
(x=y)+5+x % assign y to x, then return this value plus 5+x
\end{qv}
}
If we wanted the entire RHS of the above expression
to be assigned to \verb'x', we would need to re-write it as follows:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
x=(y+5+x)
\end{qv}
}
