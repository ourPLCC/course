{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx
\emm\LightBox{\MYlonGrammarOnly}\exx
The parse tree for a program in this language
accurately represents the length
of the list of numbers given as input -- 
count the number of instances of \verb'NUM'
in the parse trace given on Slide 1.30 above --
but the actual \verb'NUM' tokens
are not preserved in the parse tree.
The problem is that the parse tree instances of \verb'NumsNode' objects
do not have fields corresponding
to their \verb'NUM' tokens.\exx
