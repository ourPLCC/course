{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
It may appear that we have simply added recursive calls to \verb'apply'
to the already recursive calls to \verb'eval'.
The difference is that once we call \verb'apply',
we do not need to preserve the current execution context.
Languages that implement tail call elimination (look this up!)
do this explicitly: see Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, and Scala.\exx
If our implementation language supported tail call elimination,
we wouldn't need to worry about this.
In Java it's not as simple,
since Java does not do tail call elimination --
but we can accomplish essentially the same thing
through a technique called {\em trampolining}.
This technique de-couples the recursive calls to \verb'apply'
by looping instead.  The next slide shows how this works:
