{\bf Exception Handling} (continued)\exx
Since we want to maintain static scope rules
in ordinary expression evaluation,
but allow dynamic scope rules in exception handling,
we maintain two environments:
a static environment for expression evaluation --
usually called \verb'env' --
and a dynamic environment for exception handling --
usually called \verb'xenv'.
Both \verb'env' and \verb'xenv' are passed
to \verb'eval' methods,
but the \verb'xenv' environment is used only
when installing handlers (in a \verb'catch' expression)
and when throwing exceptions.\exx
Here is the code for a \verb'CatchExp'.
The code for \verb'HandlerDecls' is on the next page.

\begin{qv}
CatchExp
%%%
    public ACont eval(Env env, Env xenv, VCont vcont) {
        xenv = handlerDecls.addBindings(env, xenv, vcont);
        return new EvalCont(exp, env, xenv, vcont);
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
