The \verb'<dfrq>' nonterminal suggests its four variants:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep -0.1in
\item[d] stands for {\em delete}
\item[f] stands for {\em fact}
\item[r] stands for {\em rule}
\item[q] stands for {\em query}
\end{itemize}
Here are some examples of {\em facts}, written in the \verb'ABC' language:
\begin{qv}
planet(earth).
planet(mercury).
planet(jupiter).
larger(jupiter,earth).
larger(earth,mercury).
\end{qv}
If we want to find all of the planets that the current systems knows about,
we would write the following {\em query}:
\begin{qv}
planet(X)?
\end{qv}
The system responds with the following result
(the planets may appear in any order):
\begin{qv}
3 matches:
planet(earth)
planet(mercury)
planet(jupiter)
\end{qv}
