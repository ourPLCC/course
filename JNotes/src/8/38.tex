{\bf Exception Handling} (continued)\exx
The exception environment rules
when evaluating expressions,
defining handlers,
and throwing exceptions are:
\begin{itemize}
\parskip 0ex
\item
  The top-level exception environment is always empty.
\item
  Handlers defined in a \verb'catch' expression are added
  to the exception environment in which the \verb'catch' expression appears,
  and this extended exception environment becomes the exception environment
  in which the \verb'catch' expression body is evaluated.
\item
  A handler defined in a \verb'catch' expression
  saves the evaluation and exception environments
  and the execution continuation
  in which the \verb'catch' expression appears,
  in addition to the handler's formal parameters and body expression.
\item
  When evaluating a \verb'throw' expression,
  the appropriate handler is found by searching
  the current exception environment
  in which the \verb'throw' expression appears.
\end{itemize}
