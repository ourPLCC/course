{\bf Concurrency} (continued)\exx
Before creating a continuation
to carry out concurrent evaluation
of the list of expressions in a \verb'Rands' object,
we need to create an array that holds
the resulting values.
The result of evaluating concurrent expressions
must affect some sort of shared environment,
possibly the top-level environmment or in \verb'let' variable bindings.
Here's an example of such a situation:
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  count = 0
in
  letrec
    d = proc(t)
      if t
      then {set count=add1(count) ; .d(sub1(t))}
      else 0
  in
    let % the RHS expressions are evaluated in parallel
      _ = .d(1000)
      _ = .d(10000)
      _ = .d(100)
    in
      count
\end{qv}
\LARGE
In this case, the value of count ends up being 10000
and not 11100 as one would expect.
(Note the use of `\verb'_'' as a dummy variable place-holder.)
