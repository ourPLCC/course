{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx
Let's return to the list-of-numbers example.\exx

The \verb'Nums' abstract class is extended
by both \verb'NumsNode' and \verb'NumsNull' classes.
\Large
\begin{qv}
<nums>:NumsNode ::= <NUM> <nums>
<nums>:NumsNull ::=
\end{qv}
\LARGE
Clearly, when parsing the \verb'<nums>' grammar rules,
you get zero or more \verb'NumsNode' instances
but just one final \verb'NumsNull' instance.
Since the the RHS of the first \verb'<nums>' rule
has \verb'<nums>' as its last entry
(which means that this rule is {\em right recursive}),
this rule results in a recursive parsing loop,
ending only when there are no more \verb'NUM' tokens in the program.\exx
