{\bf BNF} (continued)\exx
A {\em tree} is another data type that can be specified in BNF form:\exx
\emm{\NormalBox{\MYtree}}\exx
Here, \verb'SYMBOL' is a token name that represents a string
of alphanumeric characters starting with a letter.
[Think of how to specify this using a regular expression.]
The \verb'NUM', \verb'LPAREN' and \verb'RPAREN' token names are as before.\exx
Here are some examples of trees
that you can check for syntactic correctness
using the parsing algorithm given above.
\begin{qv}
3
( bar 1 ( foo 1 2 ) )
( bar ( biz 3 4 ) ( foo 1 2 ) )
\end{qv}
