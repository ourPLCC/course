For example, if we want to define the \verb'$run()' method
in the \verb'Lon.java' source file,
we put the following lines into the \verb'grammar' file
{\em in the semantics section following the syntax section}.
The semantics section is separated from the syntax section
by a line containing a single `\verb'%''.
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Lon
%%%
    public void $run() {
        ...
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
}
The \verb'Lon' line tells PLCC that we are adding a method
to the \verb'Lon.java' file,
and the two lines containing \verb'%%%'
bracket the Java code to be added.
This technique can be used to add Java code
to {\em any} PLCC-generated Java file arising
from the BNF grammar lines.
PLCC inserts this added code at the end of the class definition
in the Java code generated automatically by PLCC for the class.
In the case of the \verb'Lon' class,
the above Java code appears at the end
of the automatically-generated \verb'Lon.java' class code.\exx
