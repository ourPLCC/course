Missionaries and cannibals learn logic programming

Pipe the output of this to the ABC language read-eval-print loop. The
output will be a list of boat trips ("m" means a missionary, "mm"
means two missionaries, etc.) to get the three missionaries and three
cannibals across the river without "incident".

A "state" in this solution is a string of the form

    sbmc

where 's' is just the letter 's', 'b' is the boat side (0=left, 1=right),
'm' is the number of missionaries on the left side, and 'c' is the
number of cannibals on the left side.

The minimal solution takes 11 steps. The start state is s033 (boat is
on left side of river, with three missionaries and 3 cannibals on the
left side). The goal state is s100 (boat is in right side of river,
with no missionaries or cannibals on the left side).
