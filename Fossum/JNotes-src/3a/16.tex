{\bf Language REF} (continued)\exx
Using call-by-reference semantics,
the program
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t) set t = add1(t)
in
  { .p(x) ; x }
\end{qv}
returns the value 4, since \verb't' denotes
the same reference as \verb'x'.
The bindings created by the \verb'let'
and then during evaluation of the application \verb'.p(x)'
(just prior to evaluating the procedure body)
are illustrated in the following figure:
