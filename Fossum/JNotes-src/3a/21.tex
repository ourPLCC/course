{\bf Language REF} (continued)\exx
Remember that we always use value semantics for \verb'let' bindings.
This means that a Language REF program such as
{\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
in
  let
    y = x
  in
    { set y = add1(y) ; x }
\end{qv}
}
evaluates to 3.\exx
Our observation (see Slide 3.79) that any \verb'let' can be re-written
as an equivalent procedure application no longer applies
with languages that implement call-by-reference semantics.
Specifically, if we attempt
to re-write the inner \verb'let' in the above Language REF program
as a procedure application using the algorithm given on Slide 3.79,
we get
{\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3 
in
  .proc(y) {set y = add1(y) ; x } (x)
\end{qv}
}
which evaluates to 4.
