{\bf Language NAME} (continued)\exx
Two actual parameter expressions 
that can appear in procedure applications
have {\em constant behavior}:
They are \verb'LitExp' and \verb'ProcExp'.
Evaluating these expressions do not produce any side-effects,
and their expressed values can never change.
(Don't confuse {\em evaluting} a procedure expression
with {\em applying} such an expression.)
Because of this, in call-by-name
we can evaluate these actual parameter expressions
directly during procedure application
and can bind their corresponding formal parameters
to new references to their values directly.
In other words, we use value semantics
for these actual parameter expressions.\exx
Evaluating variables that appear as actual parameter expressions
(\verb'VarExp') also do not produce any side-effects,
but such variables may have denoted values that can change.
We therefore use reference semantics
for actual parameter expressions that are variables.
