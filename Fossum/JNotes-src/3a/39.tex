{\bf Order of evaluation} (continued)\exx
A similar situation exists
when evaluating actual parameter expressions,
as shown by this example, assuming call-by-value semantics.
{\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t,u) t
in
  .p(set x = add1(x), set x = add1(x))
\end{qv}
}
If the actual parameters are evaluated left-to-right --
which would be the ``natural'' evaluation order,
\verb't' would be bound to 4 and \verb'u' to 5,
so the entire expression would evaluate to 4.
If the evaluation order were right-to-left,
the entire expression evaluates to 5.\exx
