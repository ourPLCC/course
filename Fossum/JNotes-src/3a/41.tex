{\bf Order of evaluation} (continued)\exx
The C language specification, for example,
explicitly states that the order
in which actual parameter expressions are evaluated is {\em undefined}.
If the order of evaluation matters and is not specified,
it is up to the programmer to
avoid actual parameter expressions that have side-effects.
For example, none of our languages specifies
the order of evaluation of expressions.
To ensure that the program on Slide 3a.39 evaluates to 4,
it could be re-written as follows:
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t,u) t
in
  let a = {set x = add1(x)}
  in
    let b = {set x = add1(x)}
    in 
      .p(a,b)
\end{qv}
