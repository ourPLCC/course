{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
The \verb'Rep' program defaults to running
the \verb'$run()' method in the \verb'Program' class,
which prints the \verb'Program' object as a \verb'String'.
(Actually, it prints the \verb'_Start' object as a \verb'String',
but since the \verb'Program' class extends the \verb'_Start' class,
these behaviors are the same.)
As we have seen, this displays a string that looks like this:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Program@....
\end{qv}
}
So our next step is to show how we can redefine the \verb'$run()' method
in the \verb'Program' class
so that overrides the default behavior
by printing the same text as the program input
with extra whitespace removed!\exx
This means that we should see the following when interacting
with the \verb'Rep' program from Language V0:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
--> add1( +(2, 3   ))
add1(+(2,3))
--> x
x
--> +  ( p  ,
- ( q,r)  )
+(p,-(q,r))
--> ...
\end{qv}
}
