Now that we can define our own environments,
we will remove our initial environment with bindings
for Roman numerals.\exx
In the first example, a new environment is created
binding \verb'x' to 3 and \verb'y' to 8,
so that the \verb'+(x,y)' expression evaluates to 11.
{\Large
\begin{qv}
let x = 3 y = 8
in +(x,y)
  % => 11
\end{qv}
}
In the second \verb'let' expression example,
a new environment is created
binding \verb'x' to 10.
The body of this \verb'let' expression
is itself a \verb'let' expression
with bindings of \verb'z' to 3 and \verb'y' to 8.
The environment of the inner \verb'let'
extends the environment of the outer \verb'let',
so that the \verb'x' in the expression \verb'+(x,y)' is bound to 10.
The entire expression therefore evaluates to 18.
{\Large
\begin{qv}
let x = 10
in
  let z = 3 y = 8
  in +(x,y)
  % => 18
\end{qv}
}
