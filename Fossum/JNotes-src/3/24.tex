{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
We can now re-build the Java code for this grammar
using the \verb'plccmk' command.
Assuming that everything compiles correctly,
we should get the desired behavior from the \verb'Rep' program:
\verb'Rep' parses each syntactically correct input expression and
displays the resulting \verb'Program' object as a \verb'String',
which appears the same as the input with whitespace removed.
