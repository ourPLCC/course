{\bf Language V1}\exx
The \verb'Exp' class is the appropriate place
to declare evaluation behavior,
which we implement using a method called \verb'eval'.
Here is how we declare the abstract \verb'eval' method
in the (abstract) \verb'Exp' class.
Every class that extends \verb'Exp' must therefore define this method:
\begin{qv}
Exp
%%%
    public abstract Val eval(Env env);
%%%
\end{qv}
Language V1 is the same as Language V0,
except for adding \verb'eval' methods
to the classes that extend the \verb'Exp' class.
We continue to consider the only \verb'Val' object
to be an \verb'IntVal' that holds an integer value.
The file \verb'val' in the \verb'V1' directory
has the appropriate definitions.\exx
