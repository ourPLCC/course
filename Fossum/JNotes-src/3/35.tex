{\bf Language V1} (continued)\exx
In our final implementation step,
we will define the \verb'$run()' method
of a \verb'Program' object that displays
the string representation of the {\em value} of its expression.
See the next slide for how we implement this.\exx
An empty environment would only allow for integer expressions
with no variables, since every variable would be unbound.
To test Language V1, we create an initial environment \verb'initEnv'
specific to this language that has the following variable bindings
(think Roman numerals!):
\begin{qv}
i => 1
v => 5
x => 10
l => 50
c => 100
d => 500
m => 1000
\end{qv}
For Language V1, this environment can be obtained
by a call to \verb'Env.initEnv()'.
These bindings give us some variables to play with,
though, as you will see, we will dispense with them later.\exx
