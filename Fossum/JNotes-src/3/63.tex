We provided the structure of the fields
in the \verb'ProcVal' class on Slide 3.59,
and we described the semantics of a procedure application on Slide 3.60.
We now proceed to give Java code to {\em implement} application semantics.\exx
We start with the \verb'eval' method in the \verb'AppExp' class.
As shown on the next slide, 
this method carries out steps 0 and 1
of procedure application semantics given on Slide 3.60:
it evaluates the \verb'exp' expression --
which should evaluate to a \verb'ProcVal' --
and then it evaluates the operand expressions
to get a list of \verb'Val's.\exx
It then passes these arguments along
to the \verb'apply' method in the \verb'ProcVal' class
to carry out steps 2 and 3 of application semantics.
This method returns the value of the \verb'AppExp' expression.
(As we noted earlier, the operand expressions are called
the {\em operands} or {\em actual parameters},
and their corresponding values are called the {\em arguments}.)\exx
You can find the code on the following two slides.
