{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
Consider the following grammar rule in Language V0:
\begin{qv}
<exp>:LitExp ::= <LIT>
\end{qv}
This rule creates a Java class \verb'LitExp'
having a single field named \verb'lit' of type \verb'Token'.
The \verb'LIT' token name is defined in the lexical specification
to be a sequence of one or more decimal digits.\exx
Continuing in this way,
each of the BNF grammar rules of Language V0 (Slide 3.7)
defines a class given by its LHS
with a well-defined set of instance variables
corresponding to the (angle bracket) entries in its RHS.\exx
We will encounter a few situations
when two RHS entries are defined by the same name in angle brackets.
As we have already observerd,
in these cases, we disambiguate the entries
by providing different instance variable names.
