A \verb'ProcVal' object must capture
the formal parameters as an instance of the \verb'Formals' class,
and it must remember its procedure {\em body}
as an instance of \verb'Exp'.
But what environment should we use to evaluate the procedure body
when the procedure is applied?
In order to conform to our notion of {\em static scope rules},
we want to evaluate the procedure body
{\em using the environment in which the procedure is defined}.
So any variables in the procedure body
which are {\em not} among the formal parameters --
in other words, the variables that {\em occur free} in the procedure body --
are bound to their values in the environment
in which the procedure is defined.\exx
In Programming Languages terminology, the term {\em closure}
refers to an entity that captures all of the ingredients necessary
to apply a procedure.
In Language V4,
\verb'ProcVal' objects are closures.
