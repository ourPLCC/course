{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
We get more than a success or failure response from our parser:
{\em the \verb'plcc' parser returns a Java object
that is an instance of the class determined by the BNF grammar start symbol.}
This object is the root of the {\em parse tree} of the program
that captures all of the elements of the parsed program.\exx
In our Language V0 grammar,
the start symbol is \verb'<program>',
so the root of the parse tree is an instance
of the \verb'Program' class.\exx
