{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
We follow the method described in Slide Set 1
to modify the default behavior of the \verb'$run()' method
in the \verb'Program' class.
{\em In all of our languages,
the observable {\bf semantics} of a program
is the output produced by the \verb'$run()' method
applied to the root of the parse tree of the program.}\exx
Recall that to add methods to a class such as \verb'Program',
use the following template:
\Large
\begin{qv}
Program
%%%
<method definitions>
%%%
\end{qv}
\LARGE
Since these method definitions become part
of the code for the \verb'Program' class,
they can access any of the instance variables in the class.
So for the \verb'Program' object,
the methods can refer to the \verb'exp' instance variable
of type \verb'Exp'.
Since the RHS of the \verb'<program>' grammar rule is just \verb'<exp>',
the \verb'$run()' method of the \verb'Program' class is simple:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Program
%%%
    public void $run() {
        System.out.println(exp.toString());
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
}
