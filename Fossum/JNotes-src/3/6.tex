{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
Example ``programs'' in this language:
\begin{qv}
3
x
+(3, x)
add1( +(3,x) )
+(4, -(5,2))
\end{qv}
Observe that in Language V0 --
and in most of the other languages you will see in this class --
we write arithmetic expressions in {\em prefix form},
where the arithmetic operator (such as `\verb'+'' or `\verb'-'')
precedes its operands.
Prefix form is not entirely unusual:
languages in the Lisp family (including Scheme) use prefix form.
Contrast this to languages such as C, Java, and Python,
where arithmetic operators appear principally in infix form.
