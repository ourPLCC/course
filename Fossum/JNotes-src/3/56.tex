Finally consider the following example,
which evaluates to \verb'120':
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  fact = proc(f,x)
    if x
    then *(x,.f(f,sub1(x)))
    else 1
in
  .fact(fact, 5)
\end{qv}
\LARGE
This example,
quite a bit more subtle than the previous ones,
shows how you can achieve recursion --
factorial, in this case --
using our simple language (which does not yet support direct recursion!).
