{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
The \verb'apply' method in the \verb'ACont' class
is the fundamental action that starts off evaluation.
This method carries out some action
and returns another \verb'ACont' continuation
whose \verb'apply' method is invoked, and so on.
This proceeds until an \verb'apply' method stops the evaluation
by throwing an exception --
either a runtime exception indicating an error,
or a special \verb'ContException' indicating
that the expression evaluation has finished.\exx
In the absence of an exception,
applying a continuation involves creating a new execution context
that continues the expression evaluation.\exx
Here is the signature of the abstract \verb'eval' method
in our continuation-passing language,
declared in the \verb'Exp' class:
\begin{qv}
public abstract ACont eval(Env env, VCont vcont);
\end{qv}
This method is intended to work as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parskip}{0ex}
\item evaluate the expression in the environment \verb'env',
      yielding a value which we call \verb'val'
\item call \verb'vcont.apply(val)', yielding an \verb'ACont' instance
      which we call \verb'acont'
\item call \verb'acont.apply()' to continue evaluation
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
