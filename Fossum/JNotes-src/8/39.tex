... continued from previous slide
\begin{itemize}
\parskip 0ex
\item
  The exception environment in which the actual parameters
  of a thrown handler are evaluated is the same
  as the exception environment in which the exception is thrown.
\item
  The exception environment in which the actual parameters
  of a procedure or primitive application are evaluated
  is the same as the exception environment in which
  the procedure or primitive is applied.
\item
  The exception environment when evaluating a procedure body
  (when the procedure is applied)
  is the same as the exception environment
  in which the procedure is applied.
\item
  When evaluating the thrown handler exception body,
  the exception environment and continuation are those saved
  by the handler when the handler was defined in the \verb'catch' expression.
