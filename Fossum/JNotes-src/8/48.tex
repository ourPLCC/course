{\bf Concurrency} (continued)\exx
The race condition in the previous example can now be solved
by making the modification of \verb'count' atomic:
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  count = 0
in 
  letrec
    d = proc(t)
      if t
      then {atomic set count=add1(count) ; .d(sub1(t))}
      else 0
  in
    let
      _ = .d(1000)
      _ = .d(10000)
      _ = .d(100)
    in
      count
\end{qv}
\LARGE
This expression evaluates to 11100, as expected.
