{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
For certain expressions (such as \verb'LitExp' and \verb'VarExp')
whose values can be determined directly,
the value could be sent
to its \verb'VCont' continuation, like this:
\Large
\begin{qv}
return vcont.apply(...)
\end{qv}
\LARGE
However, this would result in building a stack frame
to call the \verb'apply' method,
contrary to our objective of using continuations (and the trampoline)
to avoid building stack frames.
