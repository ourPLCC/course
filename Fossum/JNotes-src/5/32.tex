For example, consider again the expression
{\Large
\begin{qv}
define x = 3
let
  x = 5
in
  <class end>x
\end{qv}
}
where we observed that this expression evaluates to 3.
If we replace
{\Large
\begin{qv}
<class end>x
\end{qv}
}
in the above expression with
{\Large
\begin{qv}
<class end><!@>x
\end{qv}
}
then this expression evaluates to 5
because the \verb'class' expression is defined
in the \verb'let' environment,
and so the environment captured by \verb'!@'
has \verb'x' bound to 5.
The above expression can also be written as follows:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
<<class end>!@>x
\end{qv}
}
Observe that the ``variable'' \verb'!@' is only defined
in the static environment of a class
and is bound to an object that captures
the environment in which the class is defined.
If used anywhere else, it will throw an ``unbound variable'' exception.
