A an instance of the Java \verb'EnvClass' class
has one instance variable:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
    public Env staticEnv;
\end{qv}
}
Here is the code for the \verb'EnvClass' constructor:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
public EnvClass(Env env) {
    // the static environment of this class
    staticEnv = env;
}
\end{qv}
}
The \verb'EnvClass' defines a static \verb'envClass' Java object
that is a ``singleton'' instance of an EnvClass.
This \verb'envClass' object is the root of the class hierarchy tree
whose \verb'staticEnv' is the top-level environment.\exx
A standard class (an instance of the Java \verb'StdClass' class)
has a similar constructor,
except that it builds on the environment of its superclass
as described earlier.
A standard class defines bindings
for the variables \verb'myclass' and \verb'superclass',
whose values are self-explanatory.
You can find the code for this constructor in the file \verb'class'.
