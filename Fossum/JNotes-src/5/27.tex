The RHS expressions in static definitions are evaluated
in the static environment of the class,
which extends the static environment of its superclass (and so on...).
For example, consider the following definitions and expression:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
define c = class static x=5 end
define x = 3
<class extends c static y=x end>y
\end{qv}
}
In the class that extends \verb'c', 
the value of \verb'x' on the RHS of the \verb'static y=x' expression
can be found in the static environment of the superclass \verb'c',
where \verb'x' is bound to 5.
Thus the variable \verb'y' is bound to 5, not 3,
so the expression evaluates to 5.\exx
Now consider a variant of the expression:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
define c = class static xx=5 end
define x = 3
<class extends c static y=x end>y
\end{qv}
}
In the class that extends \verb'c', 
the value of \verb'x' on the RHS of the \verb'static y=x' expression
can be found in the static environment of superclass \verb'c'.
But \verb'c' does not define a variable \verb'x',
so the value of \verb'x' must be found
in the static environment of {\em its} superclass,
the singleton \verb'EnvClass' that captures the top-level environment.
Since \verb'x' in the top-level environment is bound to 3,
the variable \verb'y' is bound to 3 as well,
so this expression evaluates to 3.
