{\bf PLCC -- Hooks (continued)}\exx
You use the final hook in an automatically-generated Java source file
to add method definitions (and sometimes field declarations)
that will be appended to the class definition.
We have already seen how this is used,
for example, in Language LON on Slide 1.48,
which we repeat here:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Lon
%%%
    public void $run() {
        System.out.print("( ");
        for (Token tok: nums.numList)
            System.out.print(tok.toString() + " ");
        System.out.println(")");
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
}
\end{minipage}
