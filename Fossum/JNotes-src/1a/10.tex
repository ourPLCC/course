{\bf PLCC -- Syntax (continued)}\exx
The RHS entries in a grammar rule are used
to declare public fields in the (non-abstract) class
associated with the grammar rule.
Only those RHS entries enclosed in angle brackets `\verb'<...>''
correspond to fields in the class.\exx
A field can correspond to an RHS token ({\em e.g.} \verb'<NUM>')
or an RHS nonterminal ({\em e.g.} \verb'<nums>').\exx
If the field corresponds to an RHS {\em token},
its field {\em name} defaults to the token name
with all of its letters in lowercase.
For example, the field name corresponding
to the RHS token \verb'<NUM>' is \verb'num',
and its field {\em type} is \verb'Token'.
If the field corresponds to an RHS {\em nonterminal},
its field {\em name} defaults to the nonterminal name (without change).
For example, the field name coressponding
to the RHS nonterminal \verb'<nums>' would be \verb'nums',
and its field {\em type} is the underlying type of the nonterminal --
in this case, \verb'Nums' --
obtained by converting the first character
of the nonterminal name to uppercase.\exx
