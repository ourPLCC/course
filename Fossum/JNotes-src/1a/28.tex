{\bf PLCC -- Comments in the lexical specification section}\exx
In the lexical specification section,
PLCC comments appearing in a token or skip specification line
are defined as matching the Java regular expression \verb'"\s+#.*"'.
Such comments are removed before attemtping
to process the remaining characters
in the token or skip specification line.
This means that a skip or token regular expression
containing a substring like \verb'" #"'
will mistakenly be considered as the start of a PLCC comment.
In this case, use \verb'"[ ]#"' instead.
