{\bf PLCC}\\
\Large
PLCC is the name of a tool set
that takes a language specification file
and generates a set of Java source files
for an interpreter for the language.\exx
The specification file is in three sections:
\begin{enumerate}
\parskip -0.5ex
\item lexical specification
\item syntax
\item semantics 
\end{enumerate}
A line containing a single `\verb'%'' is used
to separate the lexical specification section from the syntax section
and to separate the syntax section from the semantics secton.\exx
A specification file can consist
of just the lexical specification,
in which case the PLCC toolset creates only
a token scanner (\verb'Scan') for the language.\exx
A specification file can consist
of just the lexical specification and syntax,
in which case the PLCC toolset creates only
the scanner and parser (\verb'Parse') for the language.\exx
The format of a language specification file 
is shown here:
