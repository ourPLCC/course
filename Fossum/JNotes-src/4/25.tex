{\bf Language TYPE1} (continued)\exx
In order to determine the defined type of a procedure,
we need to give semantic meaning to the type expressions
used to declare the types of a procedure's formal parameters
and return type.
Specifically, we need to take a type expression
given by the \verb'<typeExp>' grammar rules
and evaluate its \verb'Type':
in other words, the semantics of a type expression is its \verb'Type'.
This is parallel to taking a value expression
give by \verb'<exp>' grammar rules
and evaluating its \verb'Val'.
Both of these evaluations are examples of semantics.\exx
For each type expression, we implement a \verb'toType' method
that returns the corresponding instance of \verb'Type'.
One thing to observe is that a type expression
does not involve any variables,
so there is no need to keep track of a type environment.
