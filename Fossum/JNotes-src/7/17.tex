Consider modifying the puzzle with the additional constraint
that every crossing has at least one passenger.
Is there a solution to this variant?
To determine this, simply remove the \verb'cross' premises
with an \verb'x' in the passenger slot (see Slide 7.14)
and see if \verb'path(s0000, s1111)?' returns a result.\exx
Another variant would have a boat with two places for passengers,
but the solution in this case would be trivial to see
``by inspection'', requiring no programming .\exx
The Prolog language, upon which Datalog (and AbcDatalog) is based,
has a much richer collection of data structures and operations
that lends itself to expressing a larger set of problems,
including those that require the use of lists and numeric operations.
