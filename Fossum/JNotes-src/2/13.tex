{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
In summary, an environment is a linked list of nodes,
where a node is either an instance of \verb'EnvNode'
(with its corresponding local bindings)
or an instance of \verb'EnvNull',
which terminates the list.\exx
The \verb'extendEnv' procedure, defined in the \verb'Env' class,
takes a set of local bindings and uses them
to return a new \verb'EnvNode'
that becomes the head of a new environment list,
extending the current environment list.
Here is the definition of \verb'extendEnv':
{\Large
\begin{qv}
public Env extendEnv(Bindings bindings) {
    return new EnvNode(bindings, this);
}
\end{qv}
}
