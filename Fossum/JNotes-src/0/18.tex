{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
To test these, create a separate directory for each test
(we use the convention that such directories have names
that are written \verb'IN_ALL_CAPS'),
and create a \verb'grammar' file in this directory
with the given contents.
Then, in this directory, run the following commands:
\begin{qv}
plccmk
java -cp Java Scan
\end{qv}
The `\verb'-cp Java'' command-line arguments
sets the Java \verb'CLASSPATH' environment to the \verb'Java' directory;
this, in turn, tells the Java interpreter
where to find the \verb'Scan' program.\exx
The \verb'Scan' program expects input from standard input
(your keyboard)
and produces output lines that list the tokens as they are scanned,
in the form
\begin{qv}
lno: NAME 'string'
\end{qv}
where \verb'lno' is replaced by the input line number where the token is found,
\verb'NAME' is replaced by the token's symbolic name,
and \verb'string' is replaced by the token's corresponding lexeme
from the input that matched the \verb'NAME' token specification.
