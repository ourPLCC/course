{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
To specify tokens, we use token specification lines
having the format
\begin{quote}
\verb'token' <symbolic name> <re>
\end{quote}
where <symbolic name> identifies the token
and <re> is a regular expression that defines the structure
of the token's lexeme.\exx
We adopt one simplifying rule
for {\em all} the languages we discuss in this class:
{\em \mbox{tokens} cannot cross line boundaries}.
Be warned, however,
that not all programming languages conform to this rule.\exx
For example, we may use the following lines
in our \verb'grammar' file to specify 
a {\em number},
the {\em reserved word} \verb'proc',
and an {\em identifier}:
\begin{qv}
token NUM '\d+'
token PROC 'proc'
token ID '[A-Za-z]\w*'
\end{qv}
We like to use symbolic names for our tokens
that make it easy to remember what they represent.\exx
You can find the documentation for regular expressions
such as these in the Java \verb'Pattern' class.\exx
