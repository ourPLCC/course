In this course, a programming language specification
is given in a text file normally named \verb'grammar'.
Each language has its own \verb'grammar' file.
A \verb'grammar' file has three sections:
the lexical specification,
the syntax specification,
and the semantic specification.
These sections appear in the \verb'grammar' file in this order:
first lexical, then syntax, and finally semantic.
A line consisting of a single '\verb'%'' separate the sections.\exx
We start by describing the structure
of the lexical specification section.
