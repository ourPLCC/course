{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
Lexical analysis takes character stream input
and produces token stream output.
For example, if a language knows only about integers
and the dot symbol `\verb'.'',
an input stream consisting of characters
\begin{qv}
23.587
\end{qv}
might produce three tokens as output, with the following lexemes:
\begin{qv}
23
.
587
\end{qv}
while a language that knows about floats and doubles
might produce just a single token, with the following lexeme:
\begin{qv}
23.587
\end{qv}
In what follows, we will often use the term
``token'' (an abstraction) when it might be more appropriate
to use the term ``lexeme'' (an instance of the abstraction). 
The context should make our intent clear.
