{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx
\emm{\Large\LightBox{\MYlon}}\exx
There are several tool sets that can be used
to convert a BNF-like grammar specification 
into a parser.
Many of these tool sets use C or C++ as the target language:
input to such a tool set is a grammar specification,
and the output is a set of target language programs
that, when compiled, produces a parser.
Learning how to use some of these tool sets can be a daunting task,
and the generated parsers can be obscure.
Furthermore, most of these tool sets are split
into two separate parts:
a lexical analysis (scanning) part and a syntax analysis (parsing) part.\exx
