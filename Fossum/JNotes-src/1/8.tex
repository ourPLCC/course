{\bf Parsing (continued):}\exx
Given a BNF grammar,
we describe here an algorithm (written in English, not Java)
that parses a sentence in the language
using what's called a {\em leftmost} derivation.
The algorithm returns ``success'' if the parse is successful,
``failure'' otherwise.
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep -0.5ex
\item
  Find the {\em start symbol} of the grammar.
  (For all of the grammars we define in these notes,
  the start symbol is
  the {\em first LHS nonterminal} in the set of grammar rules.)
  This nonterminal becomes the initial {\em sentential form}
  of the derivation.
  (A ``sentential form'' is a sentence-like thing
  that is a sequence of nonterminals, token names, and lexemes.
  A ``sentence'' only has lexemes.
  Once all of the nonterminal symbols have been removed
  and the token names have been replaced by lexemes
  using the steps given below,
  the result is a sentence.)
  Set the {\em unmatched} sentence to the target sentence.
\item
  Repeat Step 3 (see the next page)
  until the sentential form is a sentence -- {\em i.e.},
  consists only of lexemes (no nonterminals, no token names).
\end{enumerate}
