{\bf From each BNF grammar rule for a language,
PLCC generates Java class.}
A rule such as
\begin{qv}
<lon> ::= LPAREN <nums> RPAREN
\end{qv}
generates the Java class \verb'Lon'.
PLCC gets the name \verb'Lon'
from the LHS nonterminal \verb'<lon>' of this grammar rule
by converting the first letter of this nonterminal name to uppercase.\exx
PLCC determines the {\em fields}
of a Java class generated from a BNF grammar rule
from the RHS terms of the rule --
specifically, the terms that are enclosed in angle brackets \verb'<...>'.
The RHS of the \verb'lon' grammar rule given above
has one term in angle brackets:
\verb'<nums>'.
The corresponding field name in the \verb'Lon' class
is \verb'nums' (Java field names always begin with a lowercase letter).
The {\em type} of this field is \verb'Nums',
because \verb'Nums' is the name of the Java class corresponding
to the nonterminal \verb'<nums>'.\exx
Since \verb'<nums>' appears as the LHS nonterminal
on the second and third grammar rules for this language,
PLCC generates a corresponding \verb'Nums' class.
