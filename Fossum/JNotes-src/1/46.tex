So we only need to redefine the \verb'$run()' method
in the \verb'Lon' class to get the new behavior we want:
to display the values of the \verb'NUM' fields from the parse tree.\exx
Fortunately, PLCC allows us to add methods to PLCC-generated source files
by including the added methods in the \verb'grammar' file.
Every time \verb'plccmk' is run,
these added methods are incorporated
into the Java source files automatically.
