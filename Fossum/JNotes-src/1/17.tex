{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx
The following diagram shows how the output of a scanner
(a program that implements lexical analysis)
becomes input to a parser
(a program that implements syntax analysis).
The output of a parser is a {\em parse tree} --
which we describe in more detail later.\exx
\centerline{\psfig{figure=parsing.eps,width=8in}}\exx
For a particular language whose PLCC \verb'grammar' file
specifies the language tokens and BNF grammar,
the \verb'plccmk' program generates and compiles Java source files
that implement a scanner and parser
directly from the \verb'grammar' file.\exx
We start with the list-of-numbers (\verb'LON') example
to show how this works.
