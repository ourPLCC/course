{\bf Language INFIX} (continued)\exx
Here is a set of grammar rules
for arithmetic expressions that does the trick.
The \verb'INFIX' language is based on the V5 language with procedures
and \verb'letrec'.
For the sake of simplicity, we only give grammar rules
for the primitive operations,
avoiding \verb'letrec'-like expressions, \verb'proc' definitions,
and \verb'proc' applications for now.
A full grammar and skeleton semantics are provided
in the \verb'INFIX' directory.
Note that the \verb'LitExp' and \verb'VarExp' rules
have been replaced by \verb'LitFactor' and \verb'VarFactor'.
\begin{qv}
<exp>                ::= <term> <terms>
<terms>              **= <prim0> <term>
<term>               ::= <factor> <factors>
<factors>            **= <prim1> <factor>
<factor>:LitFactor   ::= <LIT>
<factor>:VarFactor   ::= <VAR>
<factor>:ParenFactor ::= LPAREN <exp> RPAREN
<factor>:Prim2Factor ::= <prim2> <factor>
<prim0>:AddPrim      ::= ADDOP
<prim0>:SubPrim      ::= SUBOP
<prim1>:MulPrim      ::= MULOP
<prim1>:DivPrim      ::= DIVOP
<prim2>:UminusPrim   ::= SUBOP
\end{qv}
