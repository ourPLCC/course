For example, consider again the expression
\begin{qv}
define x = 3
let
  x = 5
in
  <class end>x
\end{qv}
where we observed that this expression evaluates to 3.
If we replace
\begin{qv}
<class end>x
\end{qv}
in the above expression with
\begin{qv}
<class end><!@>x
\end{qv}
then this expression evaluates to 5
because the \verb'class' expression is defined
in the \verb'let' environment,
and so the environment captured by \verb'!@'
has \verb'x' bound to 5.\exx
Observe that the expression \verb'!@' is only meaningful
in the context of the static environment of a class.
If used anywhere else, it will throw an ``unbound variable'' exception.
