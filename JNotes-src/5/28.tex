The \verb'<...>' operator, when applied to a class,
extracts the static environment of the class.
When used in an expression of the form
\begin{qv}
<...>exp
\end{qv}
the expression \verb'exp' is evaluated
in the static environment of the given class.
This can be used to evaluate an expression
that refers to any static variable in the class.\exx
Consider a class \verb'c', for example.
For a static variable \verb'x' in the class \verb'c',
the expression \verb'<c>x' evaluates
to the value of the variable.
For a static procedure \verb'f' in the class \verb'c',
the expression \verb'.<c>f(...)' evaluates
to the application of \verb'f' to its actual parameters.\exx
When making a procedure application such as \verb'.<c>f(...)',
it is important to know
\begin{itemize}
\parskip -0.5ex
\item the environment in which \verb'f' is evaluated, and
\item the environment in which the actual parameters to \verb'f' are evaluated.
\end{itemize}
