The \verb'superClass' variable is a reference
to a \verb'ClassVal' object (defining)
that is the superclass (defined) of this class (defined).
The \verb'staticBindings' variable is a reference
to the the bindings of the static variable names (defined)
to their RHS values (defined).
The RHS values are evaluated in the current static environment.
(More about this later.)
[OK, so I'll stop the ``(defined)'' and ``(defining)'' stuff now,
but {\em pay attention}.]\exx
The \verb'fields' and \verb'methods' variables are references
to the \verb'Fields' and \verb'Methods' objects
that capture the class field names
and method names
and procedures -- these are not evaluated yet.\exx
The \verb'staticEnv' variable is a reference
to the static environment of this class:
it starts out extending the static environment of the superclass
with an empty \verb'Bindings' object named \verb'staticBindings'.
New bindings are added to the \verb'staticBindings' list
using the variable definitions
in the \verb'statics' parameter of the \verb'StdClass' constructor.
Each static LHS identifier is bound to the value of its RHS,
where the RHS expression is evaluated in the current static environment.
These bindings are created in order (first to last)
as in top-level \verb'define's.\exx
