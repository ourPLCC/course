{\bf Language OBJ} (continued)\exx
Although counter-intuitive,
objects are actually simpler than classes,
because an object is essentially an environment!\exx
An \verb'ObjectVal' is a Java class
that extends the \verb'Val' class.
It has a single instance variable:
\begin{qv}
    public Env objectEnv;
\end{qv}
The \verb'new' operator in our defined language
takes a class expression and returns
a Java \verb'ObjectVal' instance
that essentially couples the \verb'static' bindings of the class
with bindings for the class fields and methods.
Since our language does not define
an explicit constructor in class expressions,
object fields are initialized to \verb'nil'.
The method variable names in the class definition are bound
to procedure closures that capture the environment
that includes bindings for the class \verb'static' variables
(from the \verb'staticBindings' field), 
along with bindings for the fields as described above.
The method closures are created as in \verb'letrec',
so they can refer to themselves recursively.
As with static variables,
we disallow duplicate method variable names,
although our implementation does not check for this.\exx
