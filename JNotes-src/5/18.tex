Observe that the RHS expressions in static definitions are evaluated
in the static environment of the class,
which extends the static environment of its superclass (and so on...).
For example, consider the following expression:
\begin{qv}
define c = class static x = 5 end
define x = 3
define cc =
  class extends c
    static y = x
  end
\end{qv}
In this case, the variable \verb'y'
in class \verb'cc' is bound to 5, not 3.
