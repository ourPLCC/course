The special operator \verb'@'
returns an object
that captures the {\em current} environment,
whatever that may be.
(Recall your homework assignment that introduced this notation.)
This operator may be used
to pass a captured environment as an argument
to a procedure application or
to assign it to a variable for later reference.
\begin{qv}
AtExp
%%%
    public Val eval(Env env) {
        return new ObjectVal(env);
    }

%%%
\end{qv}
The special operator \verb'@@' does the same thing,
except that it also displays the current environment
in a human-readable way.\exx
Notice that \verb'@' is meaningful in {\em any} expression context --
because every expression is evaluated in {\em some} environment --
but that \verb'!@' is only meaningful
in an expression that appears in the context of a class,
and its value represents an environment entirely separate
from the static environment of the class.
