{\bf Classes and Objects}\exx
Compared to most object-oriented programming languages
such as Java and C++, our classes and objects are
{\em first class} -- that is,
they are values that can be created at any time and in any environment,
they can be bound to variables,
they can be passed as arguments to procedures,
and they can be returned as values of procedure applications.\exx

A {\em class} is an expressed value
that captures a collection
of variables (called {\em fields})
and procedures (called {\em methods})
and that serves as a template
to create expressed values called {\em instances} of the class.
The instances are called {\em objects},
to distinguish them from classes.
You can think of a class as a factory
that identifies how to churn out
an arbitrary number of instances (objects) of the class.
