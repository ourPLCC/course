{\bf Language PROP} (continued)\exx
We implement properties in the same way we implement call-by-name:
a property evalutes to a thunk-like object
called a \verb'PropRef' (which extends the \verb'Ref' class);
this object captures the environment in which the property is defined,
along with the property's \verb'get' and \verb'set' expressions.\exx
The expressed value of a variable bound to a property
is the value obtained by evaluating the property's \verb'get' expression
in the captured environment by calling the thunk's \verb'deRef' method.\exx
Similarly, when assigning a value to a variable bound to a property,
the thunk's \verb'setRef' method is called,
with the assigned value bound to the special variable `\verb'$''
and returning the value of the property's \verb'set' expression.\exx
