Notice that an object can see all
of the \verb'static' bindings up the superclass chain,
but that if a \verb'static' variable is bound to a procedure
(or some other value that captures an environment),
the procedure captures only the static environment of the class
and cannot ``see'' any of the fields or methods --
including the \verb'self' and \verb'this' identifiers --
in its environment.
