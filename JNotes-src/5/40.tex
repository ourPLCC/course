In method application, \verb'self' always refers to the base object,
even if \verb'self' appears in the definition of a superclass method.
This is what makes dynamic dispatch work!
\Large
\begin{qv}
define c1 =
  class
    method m1 = proc() 1
    method m2 = proc() send self m1()
  end
define c2 =
  class extends c1
    method m1 = proc() 2
  end
define o1 = new c1
define o2 = new c2

send o1 m1()  % same as .<o1>m1() => 1
send o2 m1()  % same as .<o2>m1() => 2
send o2 m2()  % same as .<o2>m2() => 2!  
\end{qv}

The following slide gives another example of dynamic dispatch.
