{\bf Language OBJ} (continued)\exx
Two predefined identifiers are inserted initially into the list
of static bindings:
one binds the identifier \verb'myclass'
to (a reference to) this class itself,
and another binds the identifier \verb'superclass'
to (a reference to) the superclass of this class.\exx
If the class expression does not have an \verb'extends' part, 
its superclass defaults to an unnamed ``parentless'' class
(an \verb'EnvClass' object in the Java implementation)
whose static environment is is the top-level program environment --
so top-level variables that have been \verb'define'd are visible.
In this way, all of the RHS expressions in the \verb'static' definitions
of such a class have access to the other static bindings in the class
and to the top-level bindings.\exx
A class expresion that specifies an explicit superclass
has an environment that extends
the static environment of that superclass,
and -- going up the superclass chain --
has access to the bindings in all
of the superclass static environments
and the top-level bindings.\exx
If a class expression has a static definition for a variable
that also appears as a static variable in a superclass,
that definition shadows the superclass variable.
We disallow duplicate LHS variable names
in a given class expression's static definitions,
including redefinitions for \verb'myclass' or \verb'superclass',
although our implementation does not check for this.
