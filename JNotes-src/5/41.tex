{\bf Language OBJ} (continued)\exx
Since we often find ourselves encountering expressions like the following:
\Large
\begin{qv}
.<.<.<.<.<.<new summer>init()>add(1)>add(3)>add(5)>add(7)>show()
\end{qv}
\LARGE
we introduce a short-hand way of writing this:
\Large
\begin{qv}
!<new summer>init()>add(1)>add(3)>add(5)>add(7)>show()!>
\end{qv}
\LARGE
The token \verb'LLANGLE', defined as the string `\verb'!<'',
introduces an expression --
which must evaluate to an environment (class or object) --
followed by a sequence of zero or more procedure applications,
each preceded by `\verb'>''.
Each procedure is evaluated in the environment
of the previous class or object,
and the procedure application itself must return another object,
whose environment is then used to evaluate the next procedure,
and so on.
The entire expression is terminated
by a \verb'RRANGLE' token, defined as `\verb'!>''.
Note that the actual parameter expressions are evaluated
in the environment in which the entire expression appears.\exx
