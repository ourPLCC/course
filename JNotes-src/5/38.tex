{\bf Language OBJ} (continued)\exx
In the \verb'OBJ' language,
the \verb'send' operator provides syntactic sugar
that is specific to method calls on a object.
Specifically, for an object \verb'o' and method \verb'm',
the following expressions are equivalent:
\begin{qv}
send o m(...)
.<o>m(...)
\end{qv}
You can think of a \verb'send' expression such as above
as sending a message \verb'm' to the object \verb'o'.
Some examples appear on the following slide.
