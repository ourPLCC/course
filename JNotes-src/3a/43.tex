{\bf Order of evaluation} (continued)\exx
The Java language specification is clear about order of evaluation:
actual parameter expressions are guaranteed
to be evaluated in left-to-right (or ``natural'') order.\exx
Order of evaluation does not matter in languages without side-effects,
which makes functional languages immune to order of evaluation issues.\exx
See \verb'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy'
for more information about order of evaluation.
