What about actual parameters that are not themselves variables?
For example, what is the value returned by the following program?
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t) set t = add1(t)
in
  { .p(+(x,0)) ; x }
\end{qv}
Clearly the {\em value} of \verb'+(x,0)' is the same
as that of \verb'x',
but does it make sense to modify the value of an expression?
In other words, if you replace \verb't' with the expression \verb'+(x,0)'
in the body of the procedure,
does it make sense to perform the following?
\begin{qv}
set +(x,0) = add1(+(x,0))
\end{qv}
Clearly the RHS of this assignment is perfectly OK --
it evaluates to 4.
But the LHS is not an L-value --
{\em e.g.}, something that can occur
on the LHS of a \verb'set' operation:
the only thing that can appear on the LHS of a \verb'set' is a variable.\exx
