What happens if you try to mutate the value
of an identifier that is one of the formal parameters
to a procedure?
For example, what value is returned by the following program?
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t) set t = add1(t)
in
  { .p(x) ; x }
\end{qv}
In our procedure application semantics
(see the \verb'AppExp' code),
the formal parameters are bound
to (references to) the {\em values} of the actual parameters.
Since the value of the actual parameter \verb'x'
in the expression \verb'.p(x)' is 3,
this means that the variable \verb't' in the body of the procedure
is bound to (a reference to) the value 3,
and evaluating the body of the procedure
modifies this binding to the value 4,
but it's the variable \verb't', not the variable \verb'x',
that gets modified.
Thus the value of this entire expression is 3.
