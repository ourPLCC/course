{\bf Order of evaluation} (continued)\exx
Unless the language specification clearly addresses the issue
of order of evaluation, the language implementor can choose
any evaluation order.
The C language specification, for example, explicitly states
that the order in which actual parameter expressions are evaluated
is undefined.
{\em If the order of evaluation matters and is not specified,
it is up to the programmer to
avoid actual parameter expressions that have side-effects}.
For example, none of our languages specifies
the order of evaluation of expressions.
To ensure that the program on slide 39 evaluates to 4,
it could be re-written as follows:
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t,u) t
in
  let a = {set x = add1(x)}
  in
    let b = {set x = add1(x)}
    in 
      .p(a,b)
\end{qv}
