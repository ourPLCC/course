{\bf Language NEED} (continued)\exx
The following example illustrates the difference
between call-by-name and call-by-need:
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t) {t;t;t}
in
  .p(set x=add1(x))
\end{qv}
\LARGE
With call-by-name,
when the procedure \verb'p' is applied,
its formal parameter \verb't' is bound to a thunk
containing the expression \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'set x=add1(x)'}.
Each time the formal parameter \verb't' is evaluated
in the body of the procedure \verb'p',
its thunk is dereferenced, resulting
in evaluation of the expression \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'set x=add1(x)'}.
So since \verb't' is evaluated three times in the body of \verb'p',
the expression \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'set x=add1(x)'} is evaluated three times,
incrementing \verb'x' from 3 to 6.
Consequently, the entire expression evaluates to 6.\exx
With call-by-need,
the first time \verb't' is evaluated in the body of \verb'p',
its corresponding actual parameter expression \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'set x=add1(x)'}
is evaluated,
which has the side-effect of incrementing the value of \verb'x' to 4
and evaluates to 4.
However, the thunk memoizes the expressed value of 4,
so any further references to \verb't' evaluate to 4.
Consequently, the entire expression evaluates to 4.
