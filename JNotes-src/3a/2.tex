{\bf Language SET} (continued)\exx
We introduce the notion of a {\em reference},
something that {\em refers to} a mutable location in memory.
Instead of binding a variable directly to an expressed value,
we bind the variable to a reference,
which will contain the expressed value.\\
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{ $=$ }l}
Denoted value & Ref(Val) \\
Expressed value & Val $=$ IntVal+ProcVal \\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}
If we want to mutate a variable,
we must change the contents of the memory location
the variable refers to,
not the value (reference) the variable is bound to.

The rightmost one uses a more compact representation.
