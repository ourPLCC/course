{\bf Language SET} (continued)\exx
References will also be used to implement various parameter-passing
mechanisms as described later in these notes.\exx
We choose the following concrete and abstract syntax
for variable mutation:\exx
\emm\begin{tabular}{ll}
\verb'<exp>:SetExp' &\verb'::= SET <VAR> EQUALS <exp>'\\
    & \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'SetExp(Token var, Exp exp)'}\\
\end{tabular}\exx
We can now write the following program in our newly extended
defined language:
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 42
in
  set x = add1(x)
\end{qv}
This evaluates to 43.\exx
