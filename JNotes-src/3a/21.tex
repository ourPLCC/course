{\bf Language REF} (continued)\exx
Notice that we are still using value semantics for \verb'let' bindings.
This means that a program such as
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
in
  let
    y = x
  in
    { set y = add1(y) ; x }
\end{qv}
\LARGE
still evaluates to 3.\exx
Our observation that any \verb'let' can be re-written
as a procedure application no longer applies
when call-by-reference semantics is used for parameter passing.
Specifically, if the inner \verb'let' in the above program
is re-written as a procedure application, we would get
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3 
in
  .proc(y) {set y = add1(y) ; x } (x)
\end{qv}
\LARGE
which would evaluate to 4.
