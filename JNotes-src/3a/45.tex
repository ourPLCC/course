{\bf Order of evaluation} (continued)\exx
Both Java and Python specify that actual parameter expressions
are evaluated left-to-right.
However, the C language specification
explicitly states that the order
in which actual parameter expressions are evaluated is {\em undefined} --
which means that the evaluation order is implementation dependent.
In the following C program, the output is 3
(using the GCC compiler on the date this file was last modified),
which shows that the the operand expressions
\verb'foo(3)' and \verb'foo(5)' are evaluated right-to-left.
Your mileage may vary!

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
static int xx = 0;
void foo2(int x1, int x2) {
    return;
}
int foo(int x) {
    xx = x;
    return x;
}
int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    foo2(foo(3), foo(5));
    printf("xx=%d\n", xx);
    return 0;
