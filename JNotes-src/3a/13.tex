\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t) set t = add1(t)
in
  { .p(x) ; x }
\end{qv}
The following illustration shows
\begin{itemize}
\item
the environment immediately before
the procedure application \verb'.p(x)' --
in particular, the binding of \verb'x' to a reference to the value 3,
\item
and the environment during the procedure application \verb'.p(x)',
binding the formal parameter \verb't'
to a {\em new} reference to the value 3,
not to \verb'x''s reference (which would be the dashed line).
