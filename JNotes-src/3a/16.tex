{\bf Language REF} (continued)\exx
Using call-by-reference semantics,
the program
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 3
  p = proc(t) set t = add1(t)
in
  { .p(x) ; x }
\end{qv}
returns the value 4, since \verb't' refers
to the same cell as the one \verb'x' refers to.
The environments created by the \verb'let' declarations
and then during evaluation of the expression \verb'.p(x)'
are illustrated in the following figure:
