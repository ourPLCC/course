{\bf Language NAME} (continued)\exx
A thunk amounts to a parameterless procedure
that consists of an expression and an environment
in which the expression is to be evaluated.
It looks just like a closure,
except that there is no formal parameter list.\exx
\emm\Large\VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'ThunkRef(Exp exp, Env env)'}\exx
\LARGE
A \verb'ThunkRef' is a \verb'Ref', since we want
to de-reference (\verb'deRef') it
whenever we refer to the corresponding actual parameter.
We bind a formal parameter to a thunk reference
only during procedure application.
Thunks will otherwise not play a role in expression semantics.
