{\bf Language REF} (continued)\exx
We can solve this dilemma by making sure that
if an actual parameter is an identifier
(and therefore is bound to a reference),
then the corresponding formal parameter is bound to the same reference.
If an actual parameter is something other than an identifier --
such as an expression like \verb'+(x,0)',
then the corresponding formal parameter is bound
to a {\em new} temporary reference
containing the value of the expression.
Thus {\em variables are passed by reference},
but {\em any other expressions are passed by value}.
