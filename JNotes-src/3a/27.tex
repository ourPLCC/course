{\bf Language NAME} (continued)\exx
We implement Language NAME with call-by-name semantics.
It is based on Language REF.\exx
Two actual parameter expressions 
that can appear in procedure applications
have {\em constant behavior}:
They are \verb'LitExp' and \verb'ProcExp'.
Evaluating these expressions do not produce any side-effects,
and their expressed values
(\verb'IntVal' and \verb'ProcVal', respectively) can never change.
(Don't confuse evaluting the actual parameters of a procedure application
with applying the procedure.)
Because of this, in call-by-name,
we can evaluate these actual parameter expressions directly
and can bind their corresponding formal parameters
to new references to their values.
In other words, we use value semantics
for these actual parameter expressions in Language NAME.\exx
Evaluating variables that appear as actual parameter expressions
(\verb'VarExp') also do not produce any side-effects,
but such variables may have expressed values that can change,
perhaps in \verb'set' expressions.
We therefore use reference semantics
for actual parameter expressions that are variables
in Language NAME.
