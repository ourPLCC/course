{\bf Language NAME} (continued)\exx
When side-effects are considered,
call-by-reference and call-by-name
may give different results.
Consider:
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 1
  f = proc(t,u)
        {
          set t = add1(t) ;
          u
        }
in
  .f(x, +(x,5))
\end{qv}
In call-by-reference, the formal parameter \verb't' refers
to the same cell that \verb'x' refers to (initially containing 1),
but the formal parameter \verb'u' refers to a new cell
that contains the value 6.
When evaluating the expression \verb'.f(x, +(x,5))',
modifying \verb't' in the body of \verb'f' changes the value
of \verb't' (which is bound to the same reference as variable \verb'x')
but does not change the value of \verb'u'.
Thus this expression evaluates to 6.
