{\bf Continuations}\exx
All of our non-side-effecting languages (\verb'V1' through \verb'V6')
have relied on recursion to implement iterative behavior.
See, for example, the mutually recursive procedures
\verb'even?' and \verb'odd?' shown in Slides 3.89 and 3.93.
In our Java language implementations,
any \verb'eval' call requires setting up a Java stack frame
to hold the arguments to \verb'eval'.
If evaluating the arguments requires additional calls to \verb'eval',
additional stack frames are required.
So if a procedure calls itself recursively,
its underlying Java \verb'eval' methods call themselves recursively, 
and it is possible that stack frames can build up
to exhaust available stack memory.
Even relatively small programs can result in stack overflow.\exx
