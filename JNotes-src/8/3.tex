{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
We start with language \verb'REF',
a language with \verb'set'
and call-by-reference parameter passing.
In this language,
the \verb'eval' method for expressions has a single \verb'env' parameter
that gives the environment in which the expression is evaluated.
In the \verb'REFCONT' language,
adding explicit execution context requires passing another parameter
to the \verb'eval' method,
namely a continuation.
The purpose of the continuation is to receive
the value of the expression and to determine what to do next.\exx
We implement continuations as members
of the \verb'Cont' class, with three subclasses:
\verb'ACont', \verb'VCont', and \verb'RCont'.
