{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
\Large
One useful continuation, \verb'EvalCont',
has fields for an expression, an environment, and a value continuation.
When an \verb'EvalCont' continuation is applied,
the expression is evaluated in the given environment
and its value is passed to the saved value continuation.
\Large
\begin{qv}
public class EvalCont extends ACont {

    public Exp exp;
    public Env env;
    public VCont cont;

    public EvalCont(Exp exp, Env env, VCont vcont) {
        this.exp = exp;
        this.env = env;
        this.vcont = vcont;
    }

    public ACont apply() {
        return exp.eval(env, vcont);
    }
}
\end{qv}
\Large
The continuation field \verb'vcont'
has an \verb'apply(Val)' method
that receives the expression value
and that returns an \verb'ACont' continuation
that dictates ``what to do next''.
