To summarize,
the top lines of the file, up to the first percent (\verb'%') line,
constitute the {\em lexical specification} of the language.
For this language, these lines say that whitespace
(including spaces, tabs, and newlines) should be skipped,
that a \verb'NUM' is a string of one or more decimal digits,
and that \verb'LPAREN' and \verb'RPAREN' match
the characters `\verb'('' and `\verb')'', respectively.\exx
The remaining lines of the file constitute the {\em syntax specification}
of the language, given in BNF form.
PLCC takes this file as input and generates a collection
of Java source files in a \verb'Java' subdirectory
that implement a scanner and parser for the language.
