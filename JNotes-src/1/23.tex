The above text shows just the grammar rules section
of the \verb'grammar' file we have been examining.\exx
In your \verb'LON' directory,
change to a subdirectory named \verb'Java'.
This subdirectory was created and populated by the \verb'plccmk' command.
In this subdirectory you will find (among other things)
the following Java source files:
\begin{qv}
Lon.java
Nums.java
NumsNode.java
NumsNull.java
\end{qv}
Each of these corresponds to one or more of the grammar rule lines.
For example, the line beginning with \verb'<lon>'
results in the file \verb'Lon.java' being created
in the \verb'Java' subdirectory.
As you can see from looking at the Java code in the \verb'Java' subdirectory
for the \verb'NumsNode' and \verb'NumsNull' classes,
both of these classes extend the \verb'Nums' abstract class.
This is because the \verb'<nums>' nonterminal
appears as the LHS of two grammar rules.
