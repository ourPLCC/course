For every grammar rule,
PLCC creates a Java class uniquely associated with the rule.
For grammar rules that have the same nonterminal appearing
on the LHS of multiple rules,
PLCC creates an abstract class based on the nonterminal name,
and the annotated class names become derived classes of this abstract class.}
