{\bf Parsers}\exx
Recall our grammar for a list of numbers:\exx
\emm{\Large\LightBox{\MYlon}}\exx
We have seen how to take a sentence in this language
and use a leftmost derivation to parse it.
What can we do to automate this algorithm?\exx
A {\em parser} is a program
that takes as input a sentence in a language
and that carries out a parse of the sentence,
producing either success or failure.
Building a parser from the BNF specification of a language
is conceptually simple:
we only need to write a program
to carry out the steps of the parsing algorithm.
The difficulty is the algorithm's essential {\em nondeterminism}:
given a nonterminal in a sentiential form,
how do we replace this nonterminal with the right-hand side
of the ``correct'' grammar rule
having this nonterminal as its left-hand side?
(For some grammars, there may even be more than one ``correct'' rule
that leads to a successful parse --
such grammars are said to be {\em ambiguous}.)\exx
