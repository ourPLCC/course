The parse tree for the list of numbers \verb'(3 5 8 13)' is shown here,
using a box with compartments to represent a Java \verb'List' structure:\exx
\centerline{\psfig{figure=lon-fib-list.eps,width=3.5in}}\exx
This parse tree has fewer nodes,
and the individual \verb'NUM' token values
are all packaged together into a single \verb'numList' structure.\exx
Observe that an RHS entry of the form \verb'<UPPERCASE>'
in a BNF grammar rule corresponds
to a leaf node in the parse tree,
and an RHS entry of the form \verb'<lowercase>' corresponds
to a subtree of the parse tree.
Keep this in mind when you examine the BNF grammar rules
for a particular language
and their corresponding Java source files.
