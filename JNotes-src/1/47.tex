{\bf Static Properties of Variables} (continued)\exx
\Large
It is possible for one symbol to have multiple bindings
depending on where it occurs in the program.
Consider:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
public class Bar {
  public static int x;
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    x = 3;
    System.out.println(x);
    { // beginning of block
      int x = 4;
      System.out.println(x);
    } // end of block
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}
\end{qv}
}
When this program is run, the output will be
\vspace{-0.75ex}
\begin{qv}
3
4
3
\end{qv}
\vspace{-0.75ex}
This is because the \verb'int x = 4;' line defines
a new variable \verb'x' bound to the value 4
whose scope is from its point of declaration
to the end of the {\em block} in which it is defined,
which as shown in the program comments.
In this case, we say that the definition of \verb'x' in the block
puts a {\em hole} in the scope for the global \verb'int x'.
