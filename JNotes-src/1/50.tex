{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx
Continuing with our list-of-numbers example,
suppose we want our parser to require that the numbers in our list
are separated by commas, like this:
\Large
\begin{qv}
(5, 8, 13, 21)
\end{qv}
\LARGE
How can we devise a grammar that accommodates these separators?\exx
PLCC provides a way to specify a token
that serves as a {\em separator between items
in a repeating grammar rule}.
The separator must be a bare token name (no angle brackets)
at the end of the rule,
preceded by a `\verb'+'' character.
So if we want to separate the items in our lists by a comma
(with token name \verb'COMMA'),
here is what the specification looks like:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
skip WHITESPACE '\s+'
NUM '\d+'
LPAREN '\('
RPAREN '\)'
COMMA ','
%
<lon>  ::= LPAREN <nums> RPAREN
<nums> **= <NUM> +COMMA
%
\end{qv}
}
While this grammar uses a \verb'COMMA' separator between \verb'NUM' items,
the parser generates {\em exactly the same parse trees}
for this language as for the previous specification.\exx
