{\em Occurs Free, Occurs Bound} (informal definitions):\exx
A symbol \verb'x' {\em occurs free} in an expression \verb'E'
if \verb'x' appears somewhere in \verb'E'
in a way that is not bound by any declaration of \verb'x' in \verb'E'.
A symbol \verb'x' {\em occurs bound} in \verb'E'
if \verb'x' appears in \verb'E' in such a way
that is bound by a declaration of \verb'x' in \verb'E'.
It is possible for the same symbol to occur both bound and free
in different parts of an expression.
(Note that the declaration itself is not considered
free or bound.)
\begin{qv}
proc(x) {x}                ; x occurs bound
proc(x) {y}                ; y occurs free
.proc(x) {x} (x)           ; first x is bound,
                           ; second is free
.proc(x) {x} (y)           ; y occurs free
proc(y) {.proc(x) {x} (y)} ; y occurs bound
proc(x) {.proc(y) {x} (y)} ; y occurs free
.t (u)                     ; t and u occur free
