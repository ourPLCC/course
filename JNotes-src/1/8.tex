{\bf Parsing (continued):}\exx
Given a BNF grammar, this algorithm parses a target sentence
using a {\em leftmost} derivation.
The algorithm returns ``success'' if the parse is successful,
``failure'' otherwise.
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep -0.5ex
\item
  Find the {\em start symbol} of the grammar,
  which is usually the first LHS nonterminal in the set of grammar rules.
  This nonterminal is the initial {\em sentential form}
  of the derivation.
  (We call it a sentential form because it may still
  have some token names or nonterminal symbols in it.
  Once all of these have been removed,
  using the steps given below,
  the result is a sentence.)
  Set the {\em unmatched} sentence to the target sentence.
\item
  Repeat Step 3 (see the next page)
  until the sentential form is a sentence -- {\em i.e.},
  consists only of strings (no nonterminals, no token names).
\end{enumerate}
