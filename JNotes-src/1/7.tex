{\bf Parsing (syntatic derivation):}\exx
\emm{\Large\LightBox{\MYlon}}\exx
A grammar can be used:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0ex
\item
  to construct syntactically correct sentences, or
\item
  to check to see if a particular target sentence belongs
  to the language ({\em i.e.}, is syntactically correct).
\end{itemize}
A programmer's job is to construct syntactically correct programs
in a programming language, illustrating the first use of a grammar.
This activity is called {\em programming}.\exx
A compiler's job is, in part,
to check a sentence for syntactic correctness,
illustrating the second use of a grammar.
This activity is called {\em parsing}.
