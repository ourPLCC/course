{\bf Static Properties of Variables} (continued)\exx
For a given variable, the {\em scope} of the variable is
the region of code in which that variable's binding can be determined.
Consider the following Java program:
\Large
\begin{qv}
public class Foo {
   public static int y;
   public int z;
   public static void main(String [] args) {
     // args is local to main
     Foo f = new Foo(); // f is local to main
     int x = 1; // x is local in main
     Foo.y = 2; // y is static throughout in Foo
     f.z = 3; // z is known only within instances of Foo
   }
}
\end{qv}
\LARGE
In the above code,
the scope of \verb'y' is {\em global},
from its declaration
as a \verb'public static' variable to the end of the class.
The scope of \verb'z' is {\em instance-global},
known only within (and throughout) instances of the class Foo.
The scopes of \verb'f' and \verb'x' are {\em local},
from their declarations to the end of the \verb'main' method body.
The scope of \verb'args' is also local,
from the beginning of the method body to the end.
