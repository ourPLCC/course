{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx
The parse tree for the following list-of-numbers
\begin{qv}
( 1 2 3 4 5 )
\end{qv}
is shown here:\exx

Because of this right-recursive looping,
the nodes in the parse tree drift to the right
as the number of elements in the list grows.
Clearly a list of numbers with 100 entries would have
100 \verb'NumsNode' nodes in the tree,
weighted significantly to the right.
How can we structure our tree nodes to avoid this?
