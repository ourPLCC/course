For example, if we want to add a \verb'toString()' method
to the \verb'Lon.java' source file, we put the following lines
into the \verb'grammar' file in the section {\em following the BNF section}.
This section is separated from the BNF section
by a line containing a single `\verb'%''.
\begin{qv}
Lon
%%%
    public String toString() {
        ...
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
The \verb'Lon' line tells PLCC that we are adding a method
to the \verb'Lon.java' file,
and the lines containing \verb'%%%'
bracket the Java code to be added.
This technique can be used to add Java code
to {\em any} PLCC-generated Java file arising from the BNF grammar lines.
The added code appears at the end of the class definition
in the Java code generated automatically by PLCC for the class.\exx
