{\bf Static Properties of Variables} (continued)\exx
Determing the value of an expression at run-time is at the heart
of executing a program, particularly so in expression-based languages.
Since most expressions involve variables,
evaluating an expression requires determining the values
of its constituent variables --
in other words, finding the bindings of these variables.\exx
At run-time, how can you find the binding of a variable?
There are two basic approaches:
if the binding of a variable can be found
by code that is created at compile-time,
we call it {\em static binding};
otherwise we call it {\em dynamic binding}.
Almost all programming languages commonly in use today
use static bindings,
principally because it is easier
to reason (or prove things) about programs that use static bindings.
