{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx

Observe that the \verb'LPAREN' and \verb'RPAREN' token specifications
use regular expressions having a backslash `\verb'\''.
This is because parentheses have a special meaning in regular expressions,
and the backslash turns off this special meaning.
So, for example, the regular expression \verb.'\('.
really matches the left parenthesis symbol.
(You should take this opportunity
to review how to write and interpret regular expressions
in the Java \verb'Pattern' class.)\exx
To complete this example, 
assume that you have created a directory named \verb'LON',
and that in this directory you have created a file named \verb'grammar'
that contains lines appearing above.
In your \verb'LON' directory,
run the \verb'plccmk' script as follows:
\begin{qv}
plccmk
\end{qv}
