{\bf Static Properties of Variables} (continued)\exx
In the Lambda Calculus,
if a symbol is bound by a declaration,
we can easily determine the precise declaration that binds the variable.
The Lambda Calculus is of interest theoretically,
but it has no practical value as a programming language.\exx
We described the following problem earlier,
in the context of commonly used programming langauges:
for a given variable in an expression,
to what value is that variable bound?
Most modern programming languages are {\em block structured}
and use {\em lexical binding},
which is another term for {\em static scope rules}.\exx
