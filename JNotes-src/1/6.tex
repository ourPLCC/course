The purpose of a BNF grammar is to define
the set of ``legal'' token sequences
that conform to the grammar rules.
This set is the {\em language} of the grammar.
In the context of programming languages,
these legal token sequences are called ``programs''.
We also use the term {\em syntax rules} to refer
to the rules given by a BNF grammar,
and we use the term {\em syntactically correct} to refer
to token sequences that conform to the grammar rules.
Finally, when there is little chance for confusion,
we use the term {\em sentence}
to refer to a finite length token sequence.\exx
If we had a set of grammar rules
for the Java programming language, for example,
then the set of sentences that conform to this grammar
would be the set of all syntactically correct Java programs.\exx
