{\bf Parsers} (continued)\exx
Using this trace feature,
we can construct a visual representation of the parse tree
whose root is an object of type \verb'Lon'.
The diagrams below show the parse trace output on the left
and the resulting parse tree on the right.
Nodes in the tree are represented by boxes.
The dashed lines point to tokens
that are part of the conceptual parse tree
but that do {\em not} correspond to fields in the node.
(Normally this is the case when the BNF entries on its RHS
are tokens that are fixed -- such as LPAREN.)\exx
