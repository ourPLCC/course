{\bf Drawing Envinronments} (continued)\exx
There are exactly two ways in which programs
in Language V4 create new environments
using the \verb'extendEnv' method:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0in
\item evaluating a \verb'let' expression
\item evaluating a procedure application
\end{itemize}
A \verb'let' expression,
creates a list of local bindings:
each binding uses the LHS string as its \verb'id' field
and the value of the RHS expression as its \verb'val' field.
Remember that the RHS expressions are evaluated
{\em in the enclosing environment},
not in the environment being created.
An example expression is given on the next page
