{\bf Drawing Envinronments} (continued)\exx
There are exactly two ways in which programs
in language \verb'V4' create new environments
using the \verb'extendEnv' method:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0in
\item evaluating a \verb'let' expression
\item evaluating a procedure application
\end{itemize}
For a \verb'let' expression,
a list of local bindings is created.
Each binding uses the LHS string as its \verb'id' field
and the value of the RHS expression as its \verb'val' field.
Remember that the RHS expressions are evaluated
{\em in the enclosing environment},
not in the environment being created.
An example expression is given on the next page
