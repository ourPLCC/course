{\bf Language V1} (continued)\exx
The final step is to have the \verb'toString' method
of a \verb'Program' object return the string representation
of the {\em value} of its expression.\exx
An empty environment would only allow for integer expressions
with no variables, since every variable would be unbound.
To test language \verb'V1', we create an initial environment \verb'initEnv'
that has some variable bindings:
\begin{qv}
i => 1
v => 5
x => 10
l => 50
c => 100
d => 500
m => 1000
\end{qv}
This environment can be obtained by a call to \verb'Env.initEnv()'.
These bindings give us some variables to play with,
though, as you will see, we will dispense with them later.\exx
