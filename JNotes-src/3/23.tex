We have covered all of the \verb'plcc'-generated classes
except for \verb'Rands'.
This needs a bit more attention since a \verb'Rands' object
has an \verb'expList' instance variable
which is a \verb'List' of expressions.
First examine the \verb'<rands>' grammar rule:\exx
{\Large
\emm\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\verb'<rands>' & \verb'**= <exp> +COMMA'\\
  & \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'Rands(List<Exp> expList)'}\\
\end{tabular}\exx
}
To build a \verb'toString' method for this class,
we call the \verb'toString()' method
on each of the \verb'expList' entries
and construct a \verb'String' that puts commas between them.
Here is the code:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Rands
%%%
public String toString() {
    String s = "";   // the string to return
    String sep = ""; // no separator for the first expression
    // get all of the expressions in the operand list
    for (Exp exp : expList) {
        s += sep + exp; // exp.toString() is called implicitly
        sep = ",";   // commas separate the remaining expressions
    }
    return s;
}
%%%
\end{qv}
}
