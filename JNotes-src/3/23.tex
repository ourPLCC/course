{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
We can now re-build the Java code for this grammar
using the \verb'plccmk' command.
Assuming that everything compiles correctly,
we should get the desired behavior from the \verb'Rep' program:
each syntactically correct input expression
is parsed and re-displayed as a \verb'String'
in the same form as the input,
with whitespace removed.
