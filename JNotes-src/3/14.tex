Recall that repeating grammar rules
have fields that are Java lists.
For example, our \verb'V0' grammar has the following repeating rule:
\begin{qv}
<rands> **= <exp> +COMMA
\end{qv}
This rule says that the \verb'<rands>' nonterminal
can derive zero or more \verb'<exp>' entries,
separated by commas.
The following sentences would match the \verb'<rands>' nonterminal:
\begin{qv}
a,b,c     <-- <exp> COMMA <exp> COMMA <exp>
1, +(2,3) <-- <exp> COMMA <exp>
add1(x)   <-- <exp>
          <-- empty string
\end{qv}
The class defined by this rule is named \verb'Rands'.
Its RHS shows only one nonterminal \verb'<exp>',
so its corresponding Java class \verb'Rands'
has a field \verb'expList' of type \verb'List<Exp>'.\exx
