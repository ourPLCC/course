{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
Consider the following grammar rule in Language V0:
\begin{qv}
<exp>:LitExp ::= <LIT>
\end{qv}
This rule creates a Java class \verb'LitExp'
having a single field named \verb'lit' of type \verb'Token'.
The lexical specification defines a \verb'LIT' token
to be a sequence of one or more decimal digits.\exx
Continuing in this way,
each of the BNF grammar rules of Language V0 (Slide 3.7)
defines a class given by its LHS
with a well-defined set of instance variables corresponding
to the \verb'<'{\em angle bracket}\verb'>' entries in its RHS.\exx
As we have already observed,
when we encounter situations where two RHS entries
have the same (Token or nonterminal) name in angle brackets,
we disambiguate the entries
by providing different instance variable names.
