Observe that we evaluate every expression in the list
but only return the last value.
\begin{qv}
{1;3;5}
  % => 5

{42}
  % => 42
\end{qv}
The sequence construct can be used to enclose a single expression
that might otherwise look too unwieldy.
Here's an example:
\begin{qv}
.{proc(t,u) +(t,u)} (3,4)
\end{qv}
The braces in this expression are not required,
but they help to visualize the scope of the \verb'proc' expression.
