By coincidence, the \verb'Rands' object
already has an \verb'evalRands' method
that evaluates each of the expressions
in its \verb'expList' instance variable,
so we simply re-use the \verb'Rands' class
and its \verb'evalRands' method here.

    public Env addBindings(Env env) {
        Rands rands = new Rands(expList);
        List<Val> valList = rands.evalRands(env);
        Bindings bindings = new Bindings(varList, valList);
        return env.extendEnv(bindings);
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
\LARGE
{\bf Since we can now introduce any bindings to variables that we choose
using a \verb'let' expression,
our initial environments will henceforth be empty,
without bindings for \verb'i', \verb'v', and so forth.}
