{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
The \verb'Rep' program defaults to running
the \verb'$run()' method in the \verb'Program' class,
which prints the \verb'Program' object as a \verb'String'.
(Actually, it prints the \verb'_Start' object as a \verb'String',
but since the \verb'Program' class extends the \verb'_Start' class,
these behaviors are the same.)
The default \verb'$run' behavior -- 
which would be used if \verb'$run' is not redefined in the \verb'Program' class --
displays a string that looks like this:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Program@....
\end{qv}
}
We want to show how to override the default \verb'$run()' method
in the \verb'Program' class
so that it prints the same text as the program input
with extra white\-space removed!\exx
This means that we should see the following when interacting
with the \verb'Rep' program from Language V0:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
--> add1( +(2, 3   ))
add1(+(2,3))
--> x
x
--> +  ( p  ,
- ( q,r)  )
+(p,-(q,r))
--> ...
\end{qv}
}
