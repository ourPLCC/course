{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
The \verb'Rep' program prints the \verb'Program' object as a \verb'String'.
If the \verb'Program' class does not redefine its \verb'toString()' method,
its default \verb'toString()' method is used.
As we have seen, this returns a string that looks like this:
\begin{qv}
Program@....
\end{qv}
So our next step is to show how we can define the \verb'toString()' method
in the \verb'Program' class
so that the printed \verb'toString()' value of a \verb'Program' object
is essentially the same string as the input
with extra whitespace removed!\exx
This means that we should see the following when interacting
with the \verb'Rep' program from grammar \verb'V0':
\begin{qv}
--> add1( +(2,3))
add1(+(2,3))
--> x
x
--> +  ( p  ,  - ( q,r)  )
+(p,-(q,r))
--> ...
\end{qv}
