{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
We have seen that
the RHS of a grammar rule determines
what instance variables belong to the class defined by its LHS.
Only those entries on the RHS that have angle brackets \verb'<...>'
appear as instance variables;
{\em any other RHS entries must be token names
that are used in the parse but that are abstracted away
when generating the objects in the parse tree.}\exx
For example, consider the following grammar rule in Language V0:
\begin{qv}
<exp>:PrimappExp ::= <prim> LPAREN <rands> RPAREN
\end{qv}
This rule says that \verb'PrimappExp' is a class
that extends the \verb'Exp' class
and that the instance variables in this class are
\begin{qv}
Prim prim;
Rands rands;
\end{qv}
