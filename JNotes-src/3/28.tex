Next we consider \verb'VarExp'.
Here is the code part of the grammar file
that defines the \verb'eval' behavior of a \verb'VarExp' object.
\begin{qv}
VarExp
%%%
    public Val eval(Env env) {
        return env.applyEnv(var);
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
A \verb'VarExp' object has a \verb'var' instance variable
of type \verb'Token'.
Given an environment, the value bound to \verb'var'
is precisely the value returned by \verb'applyEnv',
which in turn is the value of the expression.\exx
{\em The value of an expression consisting of a symbol
is the value bound to that symbol in the environment
in which the expression is evaluated,
as determined by the app\-lication of \verb'applyEnv'.}
