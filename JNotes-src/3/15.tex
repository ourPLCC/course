When the program
\begin{qv}
add1( +(2,3))
\end{qv}
is parsed,
an object of type \verb'Program' is returned.
The \verb'Program' object
has one instance variable: \verb'exp' of type \verb'Exp'.
The value of the \verb'exp' instance is an object
of type \verb'PrimappExp' (which extends the \verb'Exp' class)
that has two instance variables:
\verb'prim' of type \verb'Prim' and \verb'rands' of type \verb'Rands'.
The value of the \verb'prim' instance
is an object of type \verb'Add1Prim'
(which extends the \verb'Prim' class)
that has no instance variables.
And so forth ...\exx
On the following slide we show the entire parse tree of this expression.
