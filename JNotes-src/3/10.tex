{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
As we have observed, the \verb'plccmk' tool produces
a scanner (\verb'Scan')
and parser (\verb'Parser') for the grammar.\exx
Assuming that the \verb'grammar' file has been created
in a directory named \verb'V0',
the \verb'plccmk' tool creates a \verb'Java' subdirectory
with source files named \verb'Program.java',
\verb'LitExp.java', and so forth,
that correspond to the abstract syntax shown in slide 3.6.
In the \verb'Java' directory,
you can also see Java source files named \verb'Token.java',
\verb'Scan.java',
\verb'Parse.java',
\verb'Parser.java',
and \verb'Rep.java'.\exx
The \verb'Rep' program
repeatedly prompts you for input (with `\verb'-->''),
parses the input,
and prints the result --
again, a \verb'String' representation of the parse.
If you want to run this program
from the directory that has the \verb'grammar' file --
\verb'V0' in this case --
you can run it as follows:
\Large
\begin{qv}
$ (cd Java ; java Rep)
--> add1( + (2,3))
...
\end{qv}
\LARGE
As we discussed in Chapter 1,
parsing is the process by which a sequence of tokens
(a {\em program}) can be determined
to belong to the language defined by the grammar.
We showed examples of leftmost derivations
and how the derivation process can detect whether or not
the program is syntactically correct.
