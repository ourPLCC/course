{\bf Drawing Envinronments} (continued)\exx
We described the rules for {\em applying} a procedure on Slide 3.60.
In the \verb'apply' method in the \verb'ProcVal' class, 
the key steps are:
(2a) bind the procedure's formal parameters
to the values of the actual parameter expressions
(a \verb'Bindings' object);
(2b)
extend the captured environment
with these bindings to create a new environment;
(3) evaluate the procedure body
using the new environment.
The value obtained in step (3) is the value of the procedure application.\exx
Consider the following expression,
which is the same as the previous expression except
that we apply the procedure to the actual parameter 5:\\[1.5ex]
\Large
\begin{verbbox}
let
  x = 3
in
  .proc(t) +(t,x) (5)
\end{verbbox}
\emm\theverbbox\\[1.5ex]
\LARGE
From the above discussion,
this procedure application creates a local binding
of the formal parameter \verb't' to the value 5
(the actual parameter expression's value).
This binding is used to extend the environment captured
by the procedure,
and this extended environment is used
to evaluate the body of the procedure.
The value of this application is 8.\exx
The following page displays the environment created by this application,
marked with an asterisk `\verb'*''.
