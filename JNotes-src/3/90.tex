{\bf Language V6}\exx
So far, our defined language has no capability to define top-level
variables that persist from one expression evaluation to another.
A {\em top-level} variable is one that has a binding
in the initial (``top-level'') environment.
We would like to extend the language to allow for such definitions.\exx
We already have the tools to do this,
since the \verb'Env' class has methods
\verb'add' and \verb'addFirst' that makes it 
possible to add bindings to the current local environment
without having to extend it.
All we need to do is to add bindings
to the {\em initial environment},
the environment that all expressions
in the defined language extend from.\exx
The initial environment of our languages
is a \verb'static Env env' variable
in the \verb'Program' class,
obtained from the \verb'initEnv' static method
in the \verb'Env' class.
Notice that this initial environment starts out having
an empty list of bindings.
Our strategy for making top-level definitions is
to take advantage of the \verb'addFirst' method in the \verb'Env' class.
This method takes a \verb'Binding' object and adds it
at the beginning of the \verb'Bindings' object in the current environment.
When applied to the initial environment,
we can add bindings to the top-level environment that will be known
in any subsequent expression evaluation.
