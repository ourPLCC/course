{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
The \verb'Program' class has one instance variable named \verb'exp'
of type \verb'Exp'.
Since \verb'Exp' is an abstract class,
an object of type \verb'Exp' must be an instance of a class
that extends \verb'Exp': namely, an instance
of \verb'LitExp', \verb'VarExp', or \verb'PrimappExp'.
Note that \verb'Exp' does not have a constructor,
so you can't instantiate an object of type \verb'Exp' directly.\exx
The directory \verb'/usr/local/pub/plcc/Code/V0'
contains the specification file, named \verb'grammar', for this language.\exx
The \verb'grammar' file in Language V0
has three parts, separated by lines with a single `\verb'%'':
the {\bf lexical specification section},
the {\bf syntax specification section},
and the {\bf code (semantics) section}.\exx
Recall that if your \verb'grammar' file has only
the lexical specification section,
the \verb'plccmk' tool produces Java code
for a scanner (\verb'Scan'),
but nothing else.
If your \verb'grammar' file has only
the lexical specification and syntax specification sections,
the \verb'plccmk' tool produces Java code
for a scanner (\verb'Scan') and a parser (\verb'Parse') for the grammar,
but nothing else.
