{\bf Language V0} (continued)\exx
The \verb'grammar' file in Language V0
has three parts, separated by lines with a single `\verb'%'':
the lexical specification,
the grammar rules,
and the code (semantics) section.\exx
If only the lexical specification is given,
the \verb'plccmk' tool only produces Java code
for a scanner (class \verb'Scan'),
but nothing else.
If only the lexical specification and grammar rules are given,
the \verb'plccmk' tool
produces a scanner and a parser for the grammar,
but nothing else.\exx
The code section is the heart of the language semantics.
In this section, the Java classes defined by the grammar rules
are given life in terms of defining behavior --
for example, by defining \verb'toString' methods.
We will presently see how a \verb'toString' method can be used
to print the arithmetic value of an expression,
but for now we are content with simply printing
a copy of the expression itself.\exx
{\em The code section defines the language semantics.}
