{\bf Language V2}\exx
Language V2 is the same as Language V1,
with the addition of the syntax and semantics of an \verb'if' expression.
The relevant grammar rule and abstract syntax representation
are shown here:\exx
{\Large
\emm\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\verb'<exp>:IfExp' & \verb'::= IF <exp>testExp THEN <exp>trueExp ELSE <exp>falseExp' \\
  & \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'IfExp(Exp testExp, Exp trueExp, Exp falseExp)'}\\
\end{tabular}
}

Notice that we need to add
token names \verb'IF', \verb'THEN', and \verb'ELSE'
to our lexical specification,
along with their obvious regular expressions.\exx
The RHS of the \verb'IfExp' grammar rule has three occurrences
of the \verb'<exp>' nonterminal.
Since the \verb'<exp>' items on the RHS of this grammar rule define
the instance variables of the class,
we have named these instance variables
\verb'testExp', \verb'trueExp', and \verb'falseExp', respectively.
Each of these objects refers to an instance of the \verb'Exp' class.
The \verb'IfExp' class has three instance variables:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Exp testExp;
Exp trueExp;
Exp falseExp;
\end{qv}
}
[{\bf Exercise} (not to hand in):
See what would happen if you used `\verb'<IF>''
in the RHS of this grammar rule instead of `\verb'IF''.]
