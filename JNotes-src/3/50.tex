Here are a couple of other observations you should pay attention to.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the \verb'<letDecls>' rule, each \verb'<VAR>' symbol
  is called the {\em left-hand side} (LHS) of the binding
  and the corresponding \verb'<exp>'
  is called its {\em right-hand side} (RHS).
  (Don't confuse this with the LHS and RHS of the grammar rule itself.)
  All of the RHS expressions in a \verb'LetDecls' are evaluated
  in the enclosing environment.
  {\em The LHS \verb'<VAR>' variables are bound
  to their corresponding RHS expression values
  after all of the RHS expressions have been evaluated}.
  Thus the following expression
  {\Large
  \begin{qv}
  let p = 4
  in
    let p = 42 x = p
    in x
  \end{qv}
  }
  evaluates to 4
\item
  An expression such as \verb'add1(x)' does {\em not} modify
  the binding of \verb'x'.
  In other words, \verb'add1(x)' is treated like \verb'x+1'
  in Java instead of \verb'++x'.
\end{itemize}
