{\bf Language V4} (continued)\exx
Once we have procedures,
we can entirely eliminate the \verb'let' construct!
Here's an example:
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  p = 3
  q = 5
in
  +(p,q)
\end{qv}
\LARGE
This can be re-written as an application
of an anonymous (un-named) procedure as follows:
\Large
\begin{qv}
.proc(p,q) +(p,q) (3,5)
\end{qv}
\end{minipage}
