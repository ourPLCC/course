In the first example, a new environment is created
binding \verb'x' to 3 and \verb'y' to 8,
so that the \verb'+(x,y)' expression evaluates to 11.
Notice that this binding shadows the initial environment's binding
of \verb'x' to 10.
\begin{qv}
let x = 3 y = 8
in +(x,y)
  % => 11
\end{qv}
In the second example, a new environment is created
binding \verb'z' to 3 and \verb'y' to 8.
The initial environment has \verb'x' bound to 10,
so that the \verb'+(x,y)' expression evaluates to 18.
\begin{qv}
let z = 3 y = 8
in +(x,y)
  % => 18
\end{qv}
