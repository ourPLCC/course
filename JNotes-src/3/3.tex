{\bf Environment-Passing Interpreters} (continued)\exx
You should also distinguish between
the {\em defined language} (or the {\em source language})
and the {\em defining language} (or the {\em host language}).\exx
The defined language is the language to be interpreted,
and the defining language is the language
in which the interpreter is written.\exx
In the rest of this course,
the defined languages will be a collection of artificial languages used
to illustrate the various stages of language design,
and the defining language will be Java.
Don't be disappointed by the term `artificial' here:
the languages we define have significant computational power,
and they serve to illustrate
a number of core ideas that are present in all programming languages.\exx
We start with a language we call \verb'V0' --
think of this as `Version zero'.
Its \verb'grammar' specification file appears on the next slide.
