You must understand that
{\em an \verb'if' expression is an expression
and therefore it evaluates to a value.}
It is entirely unlike \verb'if' statements
in imperative languages such as Java and C++,
where the purpose of an \verb'if' statement
is to {\em do} one thing or another, not to return a value.
Also observe that an \verb'if' expression in language \verb'V2'
must have both a \verb'then' part and an \verb'else' part
