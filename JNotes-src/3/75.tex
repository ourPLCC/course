Finally, consider this example:\\[1.5ex]
\Large
\begin{verbbox}
let
  x = 3
in
  let
    f = proc(t) +(t,x)
  in
    .f(5)
\end{verbbox}
\emm\theverbbox\\[1.5ex]
\LARGE
The value of this expression is also 8.
Evaluating this expression creates three environments:
one with a binding of \verb'x' to 3,
another with a binding of \verb'f' to the closure,
and a third created by applying \verb'f' to the argument 5.
The resulting environment diagram is shown
on the following page.
The environment in which the body of \verb'f'
is marked with an asterisk `\verb'*''.
