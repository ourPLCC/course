To evaluate an \verb'if' expression with a given environment,
we first evaluate the \verb'testExp' expression.
If this evaluates to true,
we evaluate the \verb'trueExp' expression
and return its result as the value of the entire expression.
If this evaluates to false,
we evaluate the \verb'falseExp' expression
and return its result.
Each of these expressions is evaluated
in the given environment.\exx
Since all instances of \verb'Val' are really \verb'IntVal's
(for the time being),
we regard the \verb'IntVal' object corresponding to \verb'0'
to be false and {\em all others} to be true.
