{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
We represent a binding as an instance of the class \verb'Binding'.
A \verb'Binding' object has a \verb'String' field named \verb'id'
that holds an identifier name (a symbol)
and a \verb'Val' field named \verb'val'
that holds the value bound to that variable.
\Large
\begin{qv}
public class Binding {

    public String id;
    publilc Val val;

    public Binding(String id, Val val) {
        this.id = id;
        this.val = val;
    }

}
\end{qv}
\LARGE
Programming languages typically support many types of values --
such as integers, floats, and booleans.
The only \verb'Val' type we are concerned with at this point
is an integer value represented by a class \verb'IntVal'
that extends the \verb'Val' abstract class.
Later, we will add new \verb'Val' types as needed
to extend functionality.\exx
