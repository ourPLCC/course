{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
Informally, think of an environment as a linked list of local environments.\exx
An empty environment is an instance of the class \verb'EnvNull'.
\begin{qv}
public class EnvNull extends Env {

    public EnvNull () {
    }

}
\end{qv}
In the empty environment, \verb'applyEnv' --
which defaults to the \verb'Env' parent class definition --
always throws an exception,
since no symbol is bound to any value in the empty environment.\exx
