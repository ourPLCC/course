{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
A local environment should not have two different bindings with the same symbol,
although our simple implementation does not enforce this.
We will see later how to we can achieve this restriction
when we build our local environments.\exx
The following diagram gives an example
of a \verb'Binding' object
that binds the symbol \verb'"x"' to the integer (\verb'IntVal') value \verb'3',
and a \verb'Bindings' object
with a \verb'bindingList' of size three.\exx
\centerline{\psfig{figure=bindings.eps,width=6in}}
For the sake of simplicity,
we omit drawing the extra box
around the \verb'bindingList' in future \verb'Bindings' diagrams.
