{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
In addition to getting the current value bound to a symbol,
our environment implementation provides
a way to create an empty environment (one with no bindings),
and a way to extend an existing environment
(essentially to enter a new {\em block})
by adding new bindings.\exx
But wait: what type does \verb'applyEnv' return?
In other words, what exactly is a ``value''?
For the time being, we assume that a ``value'' is an instance
of a class aptly named \verb'Val'.
We will refine the notion of ``value'' later.
If you're worried about this,
just pretend that instances of the \verb'Val' class
represent integers.
[Don't confuse this use of \verb'Val'
with the \verb'Token.Val' class we described earlier --
these are not the same.]
