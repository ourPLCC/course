{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
For the remainder of these materials,
we use the representation for environments
that we have described here:
\begin{itemize}
\item an environment is a (possibly empty) linked list of local environments
\item a local environment is a \verb'List' of bindings
\item a binding is an association of an identifier (symbol) to a value
\end{itemize}
Our implementation defines the following classes:
\verb'Env' (with subclasses \verb'EnvNull' and \verb'EnvNode'),
\verb'Binding', and \verb'Bindings'
as summarized on the next slide.\exx
