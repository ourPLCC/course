{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
The \verb'extendEnv' procedure, defined in the \verb'Env' class,
creates a new environment by adding local bindings
to the current environment,
returning this new environment.
Here is the definition of \verb'extendEnv':
\begin{qv}
public Env extendEnv(Bindings bindings) {
    return new EnvNode(bindings, this);
}
\end{qv}
You can think of an environment as a linked list
of local bindings,
where a node in the list is an instance of \verb'EnvNode'
and the end of the list is an instance of \verb'EnvNull'.
