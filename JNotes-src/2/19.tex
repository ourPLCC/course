{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
We can include Java code for environments
into our PLCC specification file (usually called \verb'grammar')
in the same way that we include Java code
into our Java classes generated by PLCC.
However, the environment-related classes
\verb'Env', \verb'EnvNode', \verb'EnvNull',
\verb'Binding', and \verb'Bindings'
do not appear in our BNF grammar,
so PLCC doesn't generate stubs for them automatically.\exx
As noted in Slide Set 1a,
PLCC makes it possible to create stand-alone Java source files
in exactly the same way as it adds methods to generated files,
except that the {\em entire} code for each stand-alone Java source file --
including \verb'import' lines and the class constructor --
must appear in the language specification section
following the BNF rules.\exx
For example, to create a Java source file named \verb'Env.java',
use the following template:
\begin{qv}
Env
%%%
... code for the entire Env.java source file ...
%%%
\end{qv}
