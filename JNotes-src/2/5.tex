{\bf Environments} (continued)\exx
A {\em local environment} is a list of zero or more bindings.
In the context of block-structured languages,
you can think of a local environment
as capturing all of the bindings defined in a particular block.
We represent a local environment using the class \verb'Bindings'.
A \verb'Bindings' object has a single field named \verb'bindingList'
which is a \verb'List' of \verb'Binding' objects.
\begin{qv}
public class Bindings {

    public List<Binding> bindingList;

    // create an empty list of bindings
    public Bindings() {
        bindingList = new ArrayList<Binding>();
    }

    public Bindings(List<Binding> bindingList) {
        this.bindingList = bindingList;
    }

}
\end{qv}
