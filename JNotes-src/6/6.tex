Here is a parse trace of the arithmetic expression '1-2*3':
{\Large
\begin{qv}
<exp>
| | <term>
| | | <factor>:LitFactor
| | | | LIT "1"
| | | <factors>
| | <terms>
| | | <prim0>:SubPrim0
| | | | SUBOP "-"
| | | <term>
| | | | <factor>:LitFactor
| | | | | LIT "2"
| | | | <factors>
| | | | | <prim1>:MulPrim1
| | | | | | MULOP "*"
| | | | | <factor>:LitFactor
| | | | | | LIT "3"
\end{qv}
}
Notice how the second occurrence of \verb'<factors>' appears
more deeply nested in the parse trace,
suggesting that the multiplication operation \verb'MULOP'
will be carried out
before performing the subtraction operation \verb'SUBOP'.
This is consistent with the mathematical convention
that multiplication and division have higher precendece
than additional and subtraction.
