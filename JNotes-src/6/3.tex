{\bf Language INFIX} (continued)\exx
A related problem is called {\em precedence},
illustrated by the expression
\begin{qv}
1+2*3
\end{qv}
If the \verb'plcc' tool chose left associativity
(which is what it might have done, correctly, in the previous example),
this would be interpreted as \verb'arg1' being \verb'1+2'
with \verb'arg2' being \verb'3',
but then the result would be interpreted as 9,
whereas the correct (mathematical) interpretation would be 7.
The problem is that in infix notation,
multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.\exx
We correct this by introducing grammar rules
that make it easy to implement semantics for associativity and precedence.
