{\bf Language INFIX} (continued)\exx
A related problem is called {\em precedence},
illustrated by the expression
\begin{qv}
1+2*3
\end{qv}
If we were to chose left associativity
(which is what it might have done, correctly, in the previous example),
this would be interpreted as \verb'arg1' being \verb'1+2'
with \verb'arg2' being \verb'3',
but then the result would be interpreted as 9,
whereas the correct (mathematical) interpretation is 7.
The problem is that in mathematifcal infix notation,
multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.
(Note that virtually all programming languages that use infix notation
use the mathematical interpretation of these kinds of expressions.)\exx
We solve these problems in PLCC by introducing grammar rules
that properly handle the mathematical interpretation
of expressions -- including associativity and precedence --
and that make it easy to implement semantics.
Our grammar rules also permit using parentheses
to treat a group of terms as a single semantic unit,
so that
\begin{qv}
(1+2)*3
\end{qv}
evaluates to 9.
