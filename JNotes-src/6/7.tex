{\bf Language INFIX} (continued)\exx
An additional problem with parsing infix arithmetic expressions
is that there is nothing specific to mark the end of the expression.
With prefix notation, the end of a primitive application is always
a right parenthesis,
but with infix notation, there is nothing similar.
In most cases, it's easy to identify the end of an expression.
Consider, for example, the following sort of infix expression
that is similar to an expression in the \verb'SET' language,
except that it uses infix arithmetic operations:
\begin{qv}
if sub1(x) then x+3 else x+4
\end{qv}
The end of the expression \verb'sub1(x)'
is marked by the token \verb'then'
and the end of the expression \verb'x+3'
is marked by the token  \verb'else',
since \verb'then' and \verb'else' cannot appear
after a \verb'term' or a \verb'factor' in an arithmetic expression.
But the final \verb'x+4' might have additional terms or factors
that do not appear on the same line.
To fix this, we change the syntax for \verb'if' expressions
by adding an \verb'endif' at the end.
The resulting \verb'INFIX' expression would look like this:
\begin{qv}
if sub1(x) then x+3 else x+4 endif
\end{qv}
Similarly, we use the special token `\verb';''
to mark the the end of a program.
Here's an example of a complete program in the language \verb'INFIX'
\begin{qv}
if sub1(x) then x+3 else x+4 endif ;
\end{qv}
that takes into account these observations.
