{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
For certain expressions (such as \verb'LitExp' and \verb'VarExp'),
the expression value could be determined with little additional work,
so this value could be sent directly
to its \verb'VCont' continuation, like this:
\Large
\begin{qv}
return vcont.apply(...)
\end{qv}
\LARGE
However, this results in building a stack frame
to call the \verb'apply' method,
contrary to our objective of using continuations
to avoid building stack frames.
