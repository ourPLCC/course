{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
To evaluate a \verb'SeqExp',
we evaluate the first expression and save its value.
If there are more expressions in the list,
we evaluate each of them in turn,
keeping only the value of the last expression and passing it on
to the saved continuation.
We create a \verb'SequenceCont' continuation
that has fields for the initial expression,
an iterator that produces the next expression
in the sequence if there is one,
the environment in which the expressions are evaluated,
and the original continuation to which we send
the final expression value.\exx
The \verb'SequenceCont' class is on the next slide.
