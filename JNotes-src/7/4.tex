{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
An \verb'ACont' continuation has an \verb'apply' method
that takes no parameters.
A \verb'VCont' continuation has an \verb'apply' method
that takes a single \verb'Val' parameter,
and an \verb'RCont' continuation has an \verb'apply' method
that takes a single \verb'Ref' parameter.
All of these continuations return an instance of \verb'ACont'.
Here are the method signatures for each:
\begin{qv}
ACont: public ACont apply();
VCont: public ACont apply(Val val);
RCont: public ACont apply(Ref val);
\end{qv}
The essential purpose of the \verb'apply' method
for an \verb'ACont' continuation
is to carry out some action that represents
``what to do now''.
Its return value, an instance of \verb'ACont',
says ``what to do next''.\exx
For a \verb'VCont' continuation,
the purpose of the \verb'apply' method
is to carry out some action that represents
``what to do now with the value \verb'val'''.
Its return value, again an instance of \verb'ACont',
says ``what to do next''.
Similar remarks apply to a \verb'RCont' continuation.
You will see that the \verb'RCont' continuations are used only
to implement call-by-reference parameter passing.
