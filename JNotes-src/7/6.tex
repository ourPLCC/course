Once we have included this rule, our ``larger'' query reports this
(in some order):
{\Large
\begin{qv}
3 matches:
larger(jupiter, earth)
larger(earth, mercury)
larger(jupiter, mercury)
\end{qv}
}
Entering facts, rules, and queries can be done interactively
at the `\verb'-->'' prompt.\exx
What if we wanted to include the planet saturn in our list of planets?
We would certainly add the fact
{\Large
\begin{qv}
planet(saturn).
\end{qv}
}
We know that saturn is larger than earth, so we might then add the fact
{\Large
\begin{qv}
larger(saturn,earth).
\end{qv}
}
But upon a query of the \verb'larger' relation,
we would see no \verb'larger' relation between saturn and jupiter.
Try it!\exx
The important thing is that the query engine
cannot deduce something that is not explicitly given in facts
or explicitly deduced from rules.
