Notice that each river crossing will toggle the \verb'b' position.
(The word {\em toggle} means switching from a \verb'0' to a \verb'1'
or {\em vice versa}.)
At most one of the other \verb'fgc' positions will also get toggled,
depending on which passenger (or none) the farmer takes on the boat.\exx
Some of the states do not satisfy the constraints.
For example, \verb's011?' is not possible,
since otherwise the boat (and the farmer) will be on the starting side
and the fox and goose will be on the ending side.
(the \verb'?' just means it doesn't matter).
Here are all of the impossible states:
\begin{qv}
s011? -- fox and goose unsupervised
s100? -- fox and goose unsupervised
s0?11 -- goose and corn unsupervised
s1?00 -- goose and corn unsupervised
\end{qv}
Notice that the total number of states (possible and impossible) is 16
($2^4$) and the number of impossible states is 6,
so there are exactly 10 possible states to deal with.
Five of these have the boat (and the farmer) on the start side.\exx
A river {\em crossing} will consist of a transition
from one state to another by toggling the \verb'b' position
(the farmer takes the boat from one side to the other,
possibly with a passenger)
and toggling at most one of the \verb'fgc' positions
(the passenger).
