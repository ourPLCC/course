{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
In the \verb'Exp' class,
we start things out by defining
a simple top-level \verb'eval' method as follows:
\Large
\begin{qv}
public Val eval(Env env) {
    ACont acont = new EvalCont(this, env, new HaltCont());
    Val val = acont.trampoline();
    return val;
}
\end{qv}
\LARGE
As described on slide 7.7,
The \verb'HaltCont' continuation created here has the default behavior
of jumping off the trampoline
by throwing a \verb'ContException',
so once the top-level evaluation is complete
and its value is passed to the \verb'apply' method
in the \verb'HaltCont' object,
the trampoline loop stops
and this value is returned.
