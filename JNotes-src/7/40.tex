{\bf Concurrency}\exx
Using trampolining, we repeatedly apply continuations
until a value is returned to the \verb'HaltCont' continuation,
which stops the trampolining and returns a value.
Since each continuation contains {\em complete information}
about how the expression evaluation is to proceed,
it is possible to have multiple threads of concurrent expression evaluation
by associating each thread with a continuation
that represents the thread's current execution context.\exx
Observe that we have used a \verb'Rands' object
to evaluate a collection of expressions,
returning a list of values or references.
Such lists are used to pass arguments
to primitive operators or procedures
or to bind values to the LHS variables in \verb'let' expressions.\exx
Assuming that the order of evaluation
of expressions in a \verb'Rands' object does not matter,
we can carry out these evaluations {\em concurrently}
(or {\em in parallel}).
With suitable hardware to support real concurrency,
this can result in run-time improvement.
