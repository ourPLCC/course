{\bf Continuations} (continued)\exx
Two more expressions require our attention:
\verb'let' expressions and procedure applications.
As we have shown, a let expression can (mostly) be converted
into a procedure application,
so code for both of these should be much the same.
The caution here is that
call-by-reference parameter passing semantics for procedure application
behaves differently from the value semantics
for the RHS expressions in a \verb'let'.\exx
In the \verb'LetExp' class,
its \verb'eval' method asks its \verb'letDecls' object
to extend its environment
by binding all of the LHS variables
to (references to) their RHS values.
This extended environment is used
to return an \verb'EvalCont' object
that evaluates the body of the \verb'let'
in this extended environment
and pass its value on to the \verb'vcont' continuation.

LetExp
%%%
    public ACont eval(Env env, VCont vcont) {
        env = letDecls.addBindings(env);
        return new EvalCont(exp, env, vcont);
    }
