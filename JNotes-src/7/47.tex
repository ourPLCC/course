{\bf Concurrency} (continued)\exx
When evaluating an atomic expression,
we circumvent the evaluation of the queued expression
by evaluating the expression directly --
using a non-threaded trampoline.
Once the value has been determined,
we pass it on to the pending continuation
so the threading can continue.
Observe that during the evaluation of an \verb'atomic' expression,
the threaded trampoline stops processing queued continuations.

\begin{qv}
AtomicExp
%%%
    public Cont eval(Env env, Cont cont) {
        Val val = exp.eval(env); // don't thread on me
        return cont.apply(val);
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
\LARGE
It's harmless to evaluate an \verb'atomic' expression
in a non-threaded environment.
However, an \verb'atomic' expression must complete
before its value can be applied to the next continuation,
so deeply nested \verb'atomic' expressions can lead to stack overflow.
Using \verb'atomic' expressions should be done sparingly.
