{\bf Language TYPE1} (continued)\exx
We are left to handle top-level \verb'define's.
While this seems to be straight-forward,
we are faced with problems of unbound variables.
For example,
suppose we attempt to make the follwing definitions:
\Large
\begin{qv}
define odd? =
  proc(x:int):bool if zero?(x) then false else .even?(sub1(x))
define even? =
  proc(x:int):bool if zero?(x) then true else .odd?(sub1(x))
\end{qv}
\LARGE
When the procedure body of \verb'odd?' is first encountered,
the variable \verb'even?' is unbound,
so the type of the body of the procedure cannot be evaluated.
Any attempt to type-check \verb'odd?' fails with a type error.\exx
We can remedy this situation in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item forbid top-level \verb'define's altogether; or
\item create a mechanism to deal with unbound variables
      that makes top-level \verb'define's work.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
