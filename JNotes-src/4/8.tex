{\bf Types} (continued)\exx
Notice that static scope rules make it possible to determine
the types of variables that appear free in a procedure body.
With dynamic scope rules,
the type of such a variable may differ
from one procedure application to another,
making compile-time type checking impossible.\exx
Numeric literals all have type \verb'int'.
We predefine the identifiers \verb'true' and \verb'false'
to have type \verb'bool',
with the obvious semantics
in the test expression of \verb'if...' expressions.
The type of a \verb'let' or \verb'letrec' expression
is the type of the expression's body.\exx
Since the type of a variable is determined by static scope rules,
the only ``interesting'' types are those of procedures.
We need to add syntax rules
that permit us to declare
the return type of a procedure and the types of its formal parameters.
