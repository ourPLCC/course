{\bf Types}\exx
Every \verb'IntVal' has type \verb'int',
and every \verb'BoolVal' has type \verb'bool'.
The only other \verb'Val' object is a \verb'ProcVal'.
We need a way to give a type to a \verb'ProcVal'.\exx
When we define a procedure, we {\em declare} the types
of each of the procedure's formal parameters
and the procedure's return type.
We show how to do this shortly.
Once we know these declared types,
we can define the type of the procedure.\exx
We use the notation
\[ [\ t_1\ ,\ t_2\ ,\ \cdots\ ,\ t_n\ =>\ t\ ] \]
to represent the type of a procedure
that has $n$ formal parameters of types $t_1$, $t_2$, $\cdots$ $t_n$,
respectively, and that returns a value of type $t$.\exx
To simplify things, we do not permit the creation
of new (named) types,
so every type is either an integer, boolean, or procedure.
