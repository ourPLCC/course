{\bf Language TYPE1} (continued)\exx
What is the type of a \verb'{ ... }' expression?
Since the purpose of this statement is normally
to perform side-effects and
to return only the value of the last sub-expression,
we assume that the type of `\verb'{ ... }''
is the type of the last sub-expression.
The types of the previous sub-expressions are ignored
except that they
must not have type errors.\exx
Thus the expression
\Large
\begin{qv}
let
  x = 1
  double = proc(t:int):int set t = *(2,t)
in
  { if zero?(x) then 0 else set x = add1(x)
  ; .double(x)
  ; proc():int x
  }
\end{qv}
\LARGE
has type \verb'[=>int ]'.
