{\bf Language TYPE0} (continued)\exx
A procedure definition in our \verb'TYPE0' language now looks like this,
for example:
\Large
\begin{qv}
define add2 = proc(x:int):int add1(add1(x))
\end{qv}
\LARGE
This says that the {\em declared type}
of the formal parameter \verb'x' is \verb'int'
and that the {\em declared return type} of \verb'add2' is \verb'int',
so that the {\em defined type} of \verb'add2' is \verb'[int=>int]'.\exx
Since we have made changes to our syntax,
our expression parse trees have additional structure,
but because our \verb'eval' methods are not affected by the type information,
the \verb'eval' methods in the \verb'code' file for the \verb'SET' language
are entirely unchanged in the \verb'code' file for \verb'TYPE0'.\exx
Notice, however,
that we have not implemented any of our type rules,
so no type checking is taking place.
