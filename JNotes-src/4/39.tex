{\bf Language TYPE1} (continued)\exx
We take the second approach, with some restrictions.\exx
First, we create a new top-level operator \verb'declare'
that has a syntax similar to how we declare
the type of a formal parameter in a procedure.
This allows us to bind a type to an identifier
without actually creating a value binding for the identifier.\exx
Pascal provides such a mechanism with {\em forward} declarations,
as does C/C++ with procedure declarations.
Java does not suffer from this problem,
in part because the order of declaration of fields and methods
is not significant.\exx
A declaration has the following concrete and abstract syntax:\exx
\emm\Large\begin{tabular}{ll}
\verb'<program>:Declare' & \verb'::= DECLARE <VAR> COLON <typeExp>'\\
    & \VerbBox{\fbox}{\verb'Declare(Token var, TypeExp typeExp)'}\\
\end{tabular}\exx
