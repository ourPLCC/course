The rules for top-level \verb'define's and \verb'declare's are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[0.] A top-level identifier definition serves as a declaration
      for the purpose of determining the type of the identifier.
\item It is an error for a top-level identifier
      to be declared (hence defined) more than once.
\item If an identifier declaration precedes its definition,
      it is an error
      if the declared and defined types are not identical.
\item It is an error for a declaration
      not to have a subsequent definition,
      although this error need not be checked.
\end{enumerate}
Although you cannot \verb'define' a top-level variable more than once,
you can {\em redefine} a top-level variable
using \verb'set' if the variable has been previously \verb'define'd.
The type rule for variable assignment still
requires that the RHS type of the \verb'set'
must agree with the declared type of the variable.
