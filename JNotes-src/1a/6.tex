{\bf PLCC -- Tokens}\exx
If -- after iterating through all of the lexical specifications --
a token candidate has been identified (first longest match),
the token candidate is used 
to create an instance of the \verb'Token' class.
The \verb'cur()' method advances the input stream
beyond the characters matched,
saves the \verb'Token' object for possible future calls to itself,
and returns the \verb'Token' object.
If -- after processing any relevant skip specifications --
no token candidate has been identified,
the \verb'cur()' method throws an exception.\exx
If the \verb'cur()' method finds that there is
a non-\verb'null' saved \verb'Token' object from a prior call to \verb'cur()',
it simply returns that \verb'Token' object without any further processing.
Otherwise, processing occurs as described above.\exx
The \verb'adv()' method replaces
the saved \verb'Token' object with \verb'null',
so that a subsequent call to \verb'cur()' will be forced
to get the next token from the input stream.
(If it first detects that the saved token object is already null,
it calls \verb'cur()' to consume the next input token.)\exx
As described earlier, the \verb'cur' method returns a special
EOF token when it detects end of input.
