{\bf PLCC -- Miscellanea}\exx
The Java class names generated by the LHS of rules
in the grammar section of a PLCC file
must not conflict with standard Java class names.
This means that a grammar rule such as
\begin{qv}
<string> ::= ...
\end{qv}
will create a Java class named \verb'String',
resulting in a compile-time error.\exx
Similarly, the names of fields in the RHS of rules
in the grammar section must not conflict
with Java reserved words or predefined identifiers.
This means that a grammar rule such as
\begin{qv}
<foo> ::= <IF> <blah>null
\end{qv}
will result in a compile-time error.\exx
PLCC itself does not attempt to identify these errors,
so the errors will only show up
when compiling the Java source files.
