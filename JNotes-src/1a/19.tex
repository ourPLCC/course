{\bf PLCC -- Semantics}\exx
For example, the \verb'toString' semantics of an \verb'Interior' class
can be given as follows:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Interior
%%%
    public String toString() {
         return "("+symbol.toString()+" "+left+" "+right+")";
    }
%%%
\end{qv}
}
Similar remarks apply to the semantics of a \verb'Leaf' class.\exx
PLCC initially generates a {\em stub} for each of the classes --
both abstract and non-abstract --
that are specified by the grammar rules.
The code for PLCC semantic actions are simply added
to these Java class files.
In the above example, the code for the \verb'toString' method
becomes part of the \verb'Interior.java' file
whose stub is generated automatically by the grammar rules.
