{\bf PLCC -- Grammar}\exx
The RHS entries in a grammar rule are used
to declare public fields in the (non-abstract) class
associated with the grammar rule.
Only those RHS entries that are enclosed in angle brackets `\verb'<...>''
correspond to fields in the class.\exx
An RHS field can correspond to a token
({\em e.g.} \verb'<NUMBER>', shown on the previous slide)
or a nonterminal ({\em e.g.} \verb'<formals>', shown on slide 1a.6).\exx
If the RHS field corresponds to a token,
its field {\em name} defaults to the token name
with all of its letters in lowercase.
For example, the RHS field name corresponding
to \verb'<NUMBER>' would be \verb'number',
and its field {\em type} is \verb'Token'.
If the RHS field corresponds to a nonterminal,
its field {\em name} defaults to the nonterminal name (without change).
For example, the RHS field name coressponding
to \verb'<formals>' would be \verb'formals',
and its field {\em type} is the underlying type of the nonterminal --
in this case, \verb'Formals' --
obtained by converting the first character
of the nonterminal name to uppercase.\exx
