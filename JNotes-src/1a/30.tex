{\bf PLCC -- Hooks (continued)}\exx
The following lines in this file are called ``hooks'':
{\Large
\begin{qv}
//Formals:top//
//Formals:import//
/*Formals:class*/
//Formals:init//
//Formals//
\end{qv}
}
In the semantics section of the language specification file,
you can arrange to replace these hooks with arbitrary text as needed.\exx
Use the \verb':init' hook
to add additional lines of Java code
at the beginning of the class constructor
(called when parsing a program).
For example, consider the \verb'Formals' constructor shown
on the previous slide.
If you want the constructor to check
the \verb'varList' field for duplicate identifiers,
include the following lines in your language specification file:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Formals:init
%%%
    Env.checkDuplicates(varList, " in proc formals");
%%%
\end{qv}
}
This code will then replace the {\Large \verb'//Formals:init//'} line
appearing at the beginning of the \verb'Formals' class constructor.
(Since the ``hook'' appears as a comment in the original Java source code,
it will not affect the compiled code if left unchanged.)
