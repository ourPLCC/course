{\bf PLCC -- Semantics}\exx
If PLCC encounters an entry of the form
\begin{qv}
ClassName
%%%
...
%%%
\end{qv}
where \verb'ClassName' is not one
of the automatically generated classes,
then PLCC generates a file \verb'ClassName.java'
containing the enclosing code.
This makes it possible for PLCC to generate Java source files
that can be used to augment the semantics of the language.
For example, we will use this to implement {\em environments},
which we describe later.\exx
In this situation, there is no automatically generated stub file,
so the Java code between the `\verb'%%%'' lines
must be a complete Java program, not just a method.
