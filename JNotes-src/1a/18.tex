{\bf PLCC -- Semantics}\exx
For an instance of class \verb'Interior',
an appropriate \verb'toString' method can be:
{\Large
\begin{qv}
public String toString() {
    return "("+symbol.toString()+" "+left+" "+right+")";
}
\end{qv}
}
This relies on the proper (recursive) \verb'toString' behavior
of the \verb'left' and \verb'right' fields,
both of which are defined as instances of the \verb'Tree' class.\exx
To define these semantic actions, we add these Java methods
to the grammar specifications after the grammar rules,
separated by a single line containing a `\verb'%''\exx
Semantic actions for a class defined by the grammar rules
are generated by entries having the form
{\Large
\begin{qv}
ClassName
%%%
...
%%%
\end{qv}
}
where \verb'ClassName' is the name of the PLCC generated class name,
such as \verb'Interior'.
