{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
The \verb'isEOF()' method in the Scan class returns \verb'true'
if there are no more tokens in the input stream,
and \verb'false' otherwise.\exx
Here is a simple loop that reads and prints all of the tokens
from a \verb'Scan' object named \verb'scn'
that has been constructed from some input stream:
\begin{qv}
while (true) {
  if (scn.isEOF())
    break;
  Token t = scn.cur();
  System.out.println(t.toString());
  scn.adv();
}
\end{qv}
This loop is similar to the \verb'printTokens()' method
in the \verb'Scan' class.
(Without the \verb'scn.adv()' call,
this loop would perpetually print the first token
in the input stream.)\exx
One final note:
If a call to \verb'cur()' encounters input characters
that cannot be matched by any
of the \verb'skip' or \verb'token' specifications,
it returns an error ``token'' \verb'$ERROR'.
