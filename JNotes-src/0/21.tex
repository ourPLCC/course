{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
The \verb'adv()' method advances the scanning process
so that the token returned by the next call to \verb'cur()'
is the next token in the input.
Notice that multiple calls to \verb'cur()'
without any intervening calls to \verb'adv()'
all return the same token.\exx
A \verb'Token' object has four public fields
(also called {\em instance variables}):
an \verb'enum Match' field named \verb'match'
that is the token's symbolic name;
a \verb'String str' field that is the token's lexeme derived
from the input stream (and is returned by
the \verb'toString()' method in this class);
an \verb'int lno' field that is the line number,
starting at one, of the input stream where the token appears;
and a \verb'String line' field that is
the source line of the input stream where the token appears.\exx
For the purposes of compatibility,
the \verb'Scan' class defines methods \verb'hasNext()' and \verb'next()'
that behave exactly like their counterparts in the Java \verb'Scanner' class.
The \verb'boolean hasNext()' method returns \verb'true'
if and only if the input stream has additional tokens,
in which case the \verb'Token next()' method returns (and consumes)
the next \verb'Token' object from the input stream.
