{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
To test these, create a separate directory for each test,
and create a \verb'grammar' file in this directory
with the given contents.
Then, in this directory, run the following commands:
\begin{qv}
plccmk
cd Java
java Scan
\end{qv}
The \verb'Scan' program expects input from standard input
(your keyboard)
and produces output lines that list the tokens as they are scanned,
in the form
\begin{qv}
NAME: string
\end{qv}
where \verb'NAME' is replaced by the token name
and \verb'string' is replaced by the token's corresponding lexeme
from the input file
that produced this token.
