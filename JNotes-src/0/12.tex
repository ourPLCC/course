{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
Whenever we are faced with two possible token specifications (rules)
that match a string upon input,
we {\em always choose the longest possible match}.
So if the input stream contained the string
\begin{qv}
procedure
\end{qv}
the above specifications would produce an \verb'ID' token
with string value \verb'procedure' instead of a \verb'PROC' token
with string value \verb'proc':
both of these patterns match the beginning of input,
but the \verb'ID' match is longer.\exx
If two or more token specifications
match the same input (longest match), we always
{\em choose the first specification in our list that matches}.\exx
In summary, for a given input string, we always
\begin{enumerate}
\item choose the token specification with the longest match, and
\item among those with the longest match, 
      choose the first token specification in the list of rules.
\end{enumerate}
