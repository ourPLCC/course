{\bf Lexical Analysis, Syntax, and Semantics}\exx
The string of input characters that makes up a token
is called a {\em lexeme}.
For example, when you read printed text on a page,
you encounter a word (token),
and the particular collection of characters that make up the word
is a lexeme.
In this paragraph, the first word (token) is ``The'',
consisting of the individual letters `T', `h', and `e' (its lexeme).
{\bf A token is an abstraction, and a lexeme 
is an instance of this abstraction}.\exx
