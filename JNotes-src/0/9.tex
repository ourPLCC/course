{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
The purpose of lexical analysis is to take program input
as a stream of characters and to produce output consisting
of a stream of tokens that conform
to the {\em lexical specification} of the language.\exx
By a {\em stream}, we mean an object that allows us
to examine the current item in the stream,
to advance to the next item in the stream,
and to determine if there are no more items in the stream.
This is similar to what we do with \verb'hasNext()' and \verb'next()'
for Scanner objects in Java's \verb'java.util.Scanner' library,
where the tokens are \verb'String's that do not contain whitespace.\exx
By a {\em stream of characters}
we mean a stream of items consisting of individual characters
in a character set such as ASCII or UTF-8.
By {\em stream of tokens} we mean
a stream of items that are tokens defined by a token specification.
Our lexical analysis process provides a \verb'hasNext()/next()' mechanism
for accessing the stream of tokens,
but it also provides a similar \verb'cur()/adv()' mechanism
described in more detail below.\exx
Lexical analysis is sometimes referred to as {\em scanning},
and a {\em scanner} is a program that carries out this process.\exx
