{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
In your working directory, run your scanner
with the following command
{\Large
\begin{qv}
java -cp Java Scan
\end{qv}
}
and enter strings from your terminal
to see what tokens are recognized by the scanner.
The `\verb'-cp Java'' command-line arguments
sets the Java \verb'CLASSPATH' environment to the \verb'Java' directory;
this, in turn, tells the Java interpreter
where to find the \verb'Scan' program.\exx
The \verb'Scan' program expects input from standard input
(your keyboard)
and produces output lines that list the tokens as they are scanned,
in the form
\begin{qv}
lno: NAME 'string'
\end{qv}
where \verb'lno' is replaced
by the input line number where the token is found,
\verb'NAME' is replaced by the token's symbolic name,
and \verb'string' is replaced by the token's corresponding lexeme
from the input that matched the \verb'NAME' token specification.
