{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
To test these, follow the steps give on Slide 0.16.
Create a separate working directory for each test
(we use the convention that such directories have names
that are written \verb'IN_ALL_CAPS'),
and create a \verb'grammar' file in this working directory
with the given contents.
Then, in this directory, run the following command:
\begin{qv}
plccmk
\end{qv}
The \verb'plccmk' command
creates a \verb'Java' subdirectory
populated with the following Java source files
{\Large
\begin{qv}
Token.java
Scan.java
\end{qv}
}
along with some additional support files.\exx
Examine the \verb'Token.java' file
in the \verb'Java' subdirectoryto see
how PLCC translates the token specifications in your \verb'grammar' file
into Java code that associates the token and skip names
with their corresponding regular expression patterns.\exx
Also examine the \verb'Scan.java' file
to see how the PLCC tool set creates a scanner for the language.
You will generally never need to make changes
to these Java source files --
they are created automatically by the PLCC tool set
from the \verb'grammar' language specification file.
