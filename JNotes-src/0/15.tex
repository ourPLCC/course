{\bf Tokens} (continued)\exx
Here are some example specification files that you can try.
Each of these examples can be put in a file named \verb'grammar'
for processing by \verb'plccmk'.
These examples define what input should be skipped
and what input should be treated as tokens.
Comments in a language specification file begin
with the \verb'#' character and go to the end of a line.

\begin{itemize}
\item
\begin{qv}
# Every character in the file is a token, including whitespace
token CHAR '.'
\end{qv}
\item
\begin{qv}
# Every line in the file is a token
token LINE '.*'
\end{qv}
\item
\begin{qv}
# Tokens in the file are 'words' consisting of one or more
# letters, digits or underscores -- skip everything else
skip NONWORD '\W+'  # skip non-word characters
token WORD '\w+'    # keep one or more word characters
\end{qv}
\item
\begin{qv}
# Tokens in the file consist of one or more non-whitespace
# characters, skipping all whitespace.
# Gives the same output as Java's 'next()' Scanner method.
skip WHITESPACE '\s+'  # skip whitespace characters
token NEXT '\S+'       # keep one or more non-space characters
\end{qv}
